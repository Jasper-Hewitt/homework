EY Appoints Will Rhode as Global Private Equity ESG Leader

Global professional services firm EY announced today the appointment of Will Rhode as Global Private Equity ESG Leader. In his new role, Rhode will focus on growing EY’s private equity ESG business, and serving private equity clients embarking on their own ESG strategies.

Rhode joined EY in 2021, and has been serving as EMEIA Sustainability and ESG Solutions Leader at the firm’s global consulting arm EY-Parthenon. Prior to joining EY, Rhode worked at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), where he was the EMEA lead for financial services in the private equity and principal investor practice.

The announcement was made alongside with the appointment of Konstanze Nardi as the EY Global Private Equity Exit Readiness Leader. The appointments follow EY’s announcement last year of plans to invest $1 billion to expand its private equity capabilities and offerings in areas including value creation and portfolio transformation, deal leadership, and ESG. EY has also outlined plans to boost its own ESG capabilities and expertise, including a pledge to invest in services and solutions that help its clients profitably decarbonize their businesses and provide solutions to other sustainability challenges and opportunities.
Bridget Walsh, EY Global Private Equity Leader, said:

“Increasingly, private equity has an impact almost on all areas across every sector and businesses and clients look up to EY teams for driving long-term value. Konstanze and Will have a strong track record working with some of the largest PE clients on significant global deals and they bring exceptional knowledge, which will further strengthen the EY organization’s market leading position.”
