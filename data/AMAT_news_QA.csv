""The first thing we need to do is decouple our growth from our environmental impact,"" said Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson in July 2020, during  the industry’s biggest conference. Applied Materials supplies manufacturing and design equipment used to produce virtually every chip on the market. ""If we double or triple the size of our company, it would be irresponsible to double or triple our carbon footprint,"" he said.To address that concern, Applied Materials has committed  to cutting its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in half by 2030 and also to reducing the Scope 3 ""energy intensity"" per wafer by 55 percent in the same timeframe. Essentially, it’s seeking to reduce the amount of energy used by the fabrication processes to produce chips, and that means convincing other companies to buy into its decarbonization agenda. Those goals motivated Applied Materials in July to step out as an inaugural sponsor, along with Intel, of a program aimed at accelerating renewable energy access across the global semiconductor supply chain. The program, called Catalyze  and run by Schneider Electric, is providing suppliers with tools to decarbonize their operations. Education is a big part of the effort but — like similar programs Schneider Electric runs for Walmart, PepsiCo and a group of pharmaceutical companies  — another goal is to provide suppliers with the opportunity to participate in power purchase agreements (PPAs) negotiated on behalf of a group, not a single company.  The initial focus will be on working with suppliers in North America and Europe where renewable energy is already readily available, even though the biggest opportunity for improving energy efficiency and clean power access lies in Southeast Asia, said Chris Librie, senior director of ESG at Applied Materials.In those places, the purchasing signals provided by companies participating in the Catalyze effort could help inspire more options, Librie said. ""By working together, we can accelerate grid decarbonization in some of these markets.""Ted Jeffries, senior director of supply chain responsibility for Intel, said the chipmaker is encouraging its suppliers to set net-zero or emissions reduction targets.

Danny Whigham, the energy, utilities and resources consulting leader at PwC, said the clean energy transition is driving many industries to consider supply chain programs of this nature. ""Education is so important to ensure that all parties in the value chain can be successful and move at the same rate,"" he said. Many energy companies and utilities are stepping out to facilitate this collaboration, Whigham added. ""Now, supply chain value comes from balancing the level of risk with the cost of safeguarding your organization from future supply chain disruption, while being able to keep your commitments to supplying reliable, affordable, safe and clean energy,"" he said.

What is the anticipated growth in the semiconductor market? What action is Applied Materials taking in light of this growth? Can you also describe the Catalyze program and its significance?

### assistant:'
The semiconductor market is expected to double to $1 trillion by 2030, as reported by GreenBiz on September 14, 2023. In response to the potential growth, Applied Materials, a company supplying manufacturing and design equipment used to produce virtually every chip on the market, is focusing on minimizing its environmental impact. Its CEO, Gary Dickerson, has emphasized the need to decouple growth from environmental impact. He stated that it would be irresponsible to double or triple the company's carbon footprint with increased growth. To that end, Applied Materials has pledged to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by half and the Scope 3 ""energy intensity"" per wafer by 55% by 2030. 

In relation to this, Applied Materials initiated a program named 'Catalyze' in July (with Intel as a co-sponsor) to accelerate renewable energy access across the global semiconductor supply chain. Administered by Schneider Electric, the program provides tools for suppliers to decarbonize their operations. A significant aim of the program is to open up opportunities for these suppliers to participate in power purchase agreements (PPAs) negotiated on behalf of a group. These efforts are initially focused on suppliers in North America and Europe where renewable energy is readily available. However, the company also hopes to inspire other places, particularly Southeast Asia, to provide more renewable energy options."

That’s where I want to work! At Applied, our DEI strategy starts with leaders as champions of change  who work to break down systemic barriers, build diversity in our teams and ensure equity in our talent processes. When leaders remove barriers, we begin to see DEI operationalized in all we do.How are you building a culture of inclusion? We’ve launched the DEI Engine—a framework of tools, learning and processes—to give our leaders and employees tangible assets and learning opportunities to accelerate our culture of inclusion strategy and help them further their own inclusion journey. Our focus for 2023 is to ingrain an inclusive culture. It’s phase one of a multiyear roadmap designed to achieve our 2030 goals.What are Applied’s 2030 diversity goals?Our goals for 2030 are: I believe that as an industry leader, it is our responsibility to make the world a better place—and to lead the way when it comes to inclusive practices and broader workplace diversity.What is your strategy to meet those goals?

These actions and plans are not only for women and underrepresented minorities, but for all employees. Our overarching goal is to enable everyone in our workforce to achieve their full potential.What are Applied’s biggest accomplishments in the DEI space to date? I moved into my role to lead our culture of inclusion in 2022, and since then I’ve built a team to raise the level and increase the pace of our DEI efforts—and we’ve engaged with our colleagues outside the company to broaden the impact across the tech industry. All our work is showing up in our 2023 mid-year results, where we have achieved three of our five goals and are making strong progress on all fronts.What are the unique challenges for tech companies in attracting and recruiting diverse talent? The tech industry has historically lacked diversity due to culture and availability. At Applied, we aren’t sitting on the sidelines. We invest in building an inclusive talent pipeline to expand opportunities for those who have been traditionally underrepresented in tech. We partner with nonprofit organizations, colleges and universities to foster interest and build STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) capabilities, particularly among girls and underrepresented minorities.Through the Applied Materials Foundation’s Generation Girl®  initiative, we collaborate with U.S. nonprofit organizations to strengthen girls’ self-confidence and to grow interest and engagement in STEM subjects. Since 2018, Generation Girl has served more than 36,000 girls, with over 60% of participants coming from low-income households and identifying as Black, Latina or Native American.Recently, in collaboration with Last Mile Education Fund, we established the Applied Materials Momentum Fund , accelerating the next generation of women in engineering.

For the first time in my experience as a sustainability professional, I witnessed industry leaders coming to grips with an inherent contradiction: the promise of semiconductors marching toward becoming a $1 trillion market, while simultaneously creating a path to Net Zero carbon emissions. The industry’s growth and carbon footprint are invariably linked, presenting an enormous challenge that we must meet as an industry.Applied Materials President and CEO Gary Dickerson presented a keynote titled, “A Collaborative Pathway to Net Zero,” where he delivered a call to action for the entire semiconductor industry to get serious about collaborating to execute real, achievable plans to reach Net Zero in carbon emissions. Gary shared Applied’s playbook for Net Zero – a framework we’ve been developing for more than a year. Significantly, that playbook goes beyond our own Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which come from running the company and from the energy we purchase. In fact, Applied has made great progress in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which Gary shared and you can read more about in our latest Sustainability Report . However, the bulk of Gary’s talk was about Applied’s Scope 3 emissions, the upstream emissions from our supply chain and the downstream emissions from the use of our products by customers. Since these are not in our direct control, you might say that’s someone else’s problem. But Applied agrees with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) framework, which says companies need to influence their Scope 3 emissions as well to achieve Net Zero. It’s not an easy task. Gary showed that as we grow industry revenue, we grow carbon emissions. In fact, as the new AI and IoT computing era promises to double semiconductor revenue by around 2030, carbon emissions are forecast to quadruple. If we don’t collaborate to bend that curve as semiconductors become more pervasive throughout the economy and society, our industry won’t become more sustainable.That’s what the playbook is all about. Gary showed the pathway for Applied to get to Net Zero. And it’s a playbook that other companies can evaluate for their own Net Zero strategies. We stand ready to work with the entire industry ecosystem, and we’re grateful for the comments Micron, ST Microelectronics and Schneider Electric contributed to Gary’s keynote.

What was the main takeaway from SEMICON West 2023 and who delivered a significant keynote?
### assistant:;
SEMICON West 2023 marked a significant turning point for the semiconductor industry, as industry leaders started grappling with the inherent contradiction of the industry potentially becoming a $1 trillion market while striving for Net Zero carbon emissions. Applied Materials President and CEO Gary Dickerson delivered a keynote titled, “A Collaborative Pathway to Net Zero.” He urged the entire semiconductor industry to work together to develop and execute achievable plans for reaching Net Zero in carbon emissions. This challenge arises from the correlation between the industry's growth and its carbon footprint. Dickerson also presented Applied’s playbook for Net Zero, which extends to Scope 3 emissions - namely, upstream emissions from their supply chain and downstream emissions from the use of their products by customers. He emphasized that without joint efforts to mitigate carbon emissions, the expected growth of the semiconductor market could potentially quadruple carbon emissions. The event took place on July 21, 2023, as reported by ThreeBLMedia."

The report highlights the impact of the company’s ESG efforts within its own organization, with its suppliers and customers and on the global electronics ecosystem.“Applied Materials is at the forefront of semiconductor technologies that play an ever-increasing role in our lives,” said Gary Dickerson, President and CEO of Applied Materials. “As we bring transformative new innovations to market, we are working closely with our suppliers and customers to minimize our environmental impact by reducing our products’ resource consumption and carbon emissions. We are also continuing our strong commitment to a culture of inclusion at Applied where everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute and grow in their careers.” Driven by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and a sharp increase in the number of smart, connected devices, the market for semiconductors is projected to approximately double and reach $1 trillion over the next decade. It is imperative for the chip manufacturing ecosystem to work collaboratively to decouple this expected growth from the industry’s carbon emissions. In 2022, Applied continued to make progress in reducing its carbon footprint, achieving 100-percent renewable electricity use in the U.S. and 69 percent globally, resulting in a 3-percent reduction from its 2019 baseline in the company’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions – those produced directly by the company and by the energy it purchases. During the same period, Applied’s energy consumption rose by approximately 13 percent, which demonstrates the company’s progress in decoupling emissions growth from business growth. Recognizing the need to redouble its efforts in the future, Applied submitted science-based reduction targets for its Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions – those generated across the entire value chain – to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and the company set a new goal to reduce its Scope 3 - Category 11 (use of sold products) emissions per wafer across new semiconductor products by 55 percent by 2030 (from its 2019 baseline).

64e5143dfc38dc374bec1335,GreenBiz,Chemical Safety,How the new EU directive will rewrite ESG reporting,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/how-new-eu-directive-will-rewrite-esg-reporting,2023-05-01,Matt Orsagh,"Europe has long been the trendsetter in policy and regulation around environmental, social and governance issues. The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  is the latest in a line of European Union policies intended to nudge economic and investment activity towards more sustainable outcomes.The CSRD replaced the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) , which only covered the disclosure requirements for about 11,000 EU companies. In contrast, the CSRD will require nearly 50,000 companies to enhance their reporting around sustainability. This number includes about 10,000 companies outside the EU, and it doesn’t just include the largest of the large companies. The CSRD was adopted by the EU Council in November. EU companies already subject to the NFRD will have to begin compliance with the CSRD, which means reporting in 2024. Those for whom this reporting will be new, including companies outside the EU, have until 2025 to begin complying.The NFRD was never mandatory. As a result, investors, regulators and civil society groups were often frustrated with the lack of sustainability-related information from companies and the lack of comparability of that data. The European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) recently released an implementation appraisal on the NFRD that highlighted many shortcomings of the NFRD: The purpose of the CSRD is to provide investors and businesses with more information about the sustainability of companies operating in the EU, that is timely, consistent and comparable.The rules will cover both public and private business that satisfy two of the following criteria: Compliance with CSRD isn’t that far away. Companies that meet the reporting requirements will have to submit their first report of aligning with CSRD by Jan. 1, 2025. Smaller and medium-sized entities (SMEs) won’t have to comply with the rules until January 2026. Companies outside of Europe that do business in the EU will also be covered by the new rules — companies that generate total revenue of $167 million  in the EU and have at least one branch or subsidiary in the EU with more than $44.51 million in net revenue will be required to comply with the new disclosure requirements. In essence, the CSRD is becoming the de facto sustainability disclosure regulation for large global companies; as companies with significant business in Europe will have to adhere to the rules Europe sets down. The hope of European regulators — and sustainability-minded professionals around the world — is that this higher disclosure bar will export European best practices in disclosure globally. As large companies in global markets are forced to raise their standards, these disclosure standards will cause other companies in those markets to follow the more stringent disclosure standards set by the EU in order to keep up with best practices.In addition to information already required by the NFRD, companies that comply with the CSRD will have to publish information related to: Companies will be required to set annual ESG targets and report their process hitting these targets, including transition plans (if any). The CSRD will require third-party assurances, including integration into the auditor’s report, a requirement not covered by the NFRD. This information will be required to be presented in a company’s annual financial reports, not in a separate sustainability report. Assurances can at first be ""limited"" but must reach the threshold of ""reasonable"" assurances by 2028. For those of you out there who are not accountants (good for you), reasonable assurances amount to an auditor affirming that the information reported is materially correct, while limited assurances simply state that the auditor is not aware of any material modifications that need to be made. The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) is drafting the upcoming EU Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) that the CSRD will adopt as its reporting standard. The European Commission is due to adopt the initial ESRS standards in mid-2023. If all of this sounds like a lot of work, you are right. If all of this sounds like a lot of work and a little bit intimidating if you are not a European company used to European regulation, accounting and disclosure standards, you are right again. Companies outside the EU that will be subject to CSRD reporting have realized the daunting task ahead of them. Those ahead of the curve have already started the process of adjustment to the CSRD landscape.Chris Librie, senior director of ESG at Applied Materials, acknowledged that CSRD will require companies outside the EU to change their perspective on sustainability. ""CSRD is pretty comprehensive,"" Librie said. ""It involves double materiality, which may bring into scope things that we may not have considered. For example, we haven’t traditionally looked at biodiversity, but that may come up."" Most companies will need to expand their ability to measure and manage sustainability issues in their own operations; as well down their supply chains to comply with CSRD disclosure rules.""Our ESG team is fairly small,"" Librie said, ""so we will be reaching to other divisions such as human resources, environmental health and safety and others, as well as our outside auditors and consultants. The number of potential topics are so many that we are taking a team approach to develop a structured approach to the CSRD process.""The race is on to train financial professionals for the transition. Several organizations are working with companies to help them prepare for the transition. One of these is Accounting for Sustainability (A4S) . A4S was established by King Charles III in 2004, with the aim of working with chief financial officers and other financial leaders to drive a shift towards more sustainable business models. A4S routinely hosts workshops to share best practices and build knowledge of financial professionals to bring them up to speed. Brad Sparks, executive director of A4S Foundation U.S.,  emphasized how A4S is seeing significant interest from finance and accounting professionals that A4S works with around CSRD.""CSRD has become part of the reporting workshops that we host,"" Sparks said. ""We also started a new controllers forum and had a meeting earlier this year where we brought in someone from EFRAG to discuss the emerging ESRS standards. The forum is designed for chief accounting officers, controllers and ESG controllers to exchange insights, challenges and responses to sustainability issues among peers. Our initial meeting had a focus on double materiality — a topic that is new to many in the finance and accounting community.""Part of the learning curve for those outside the EU will be navigating the differences in accounting standards, investor expectations and legal systems that underpin EU regulation and norms outside the EU. ""Finance and accounting professionals in the United States are seeking additional guidance to help with the emerging standards,"" Sparks said. ""In general, global accounting standards are typically principles-based, while U.S. accounting (GAAP) is typically rules-based. This is similar with the ESRS following a more principles-based approach, which some in the U.S. view as more challenging to implement."" Although adjusting to a CSRD world will take time and resources, in the end, the goal is to provide investors, policymakers, civil society and companies themselves with better information. It may move sustainability reporting more to the mainstream, which has both positive and negative implications.  Preparing for CSRD reporting will be a step change in managing and measuring sustainability data for many companies outside the EU. Companies that need to report under the CSRD standard will need to start now if they haven’t already: January 2025 isn’t that far away. There are steps companies can take to get ready. Here are just a few places to start:""I see this possibly driving companies toward more integrated reporting,"" Librie said. ""I think ultimately we will see more 10-Ks and sustainability reports that merge, so we will have a one-stop shop for all this information. That is a positive but a potential negative is that in a 10-K type document, you can’t be as verbose. You have to be more economical about telling your story, and that might make ESG engagement more challenging."" ""Companies are seeking to understand how they can comply with reporting requirements in an effective, efficient and impactful manner,"" Sparks said. ""They want to understand what best practices are and are looking for more guidance."" Sparks noted that A4S plans to hold more workshops around CSRD in the future, as it sees increasing demand from the CFOs and financial professionals they meet with.","GreenBiz: 2023-05-01 Europe has long been the trendsetter in policy and regulation around environmental, social and governance issues.

The hope of European regulators — and sustainability-minded professionals around the world — is that this higher disclosure bar will export European best practices in disclosure globally. As large companies in global markets are forced to raise their standards, these disclosure standards will cause other companies in those markets to follow the more stringent disclosure standards set by the EU in order to keep up with best practices.In addition to information already required by the NFRD, companies that comply with the CSRD will have to publish information related to: Companies will be required to set annual ESG targets and report their process hitting these targets, including transition plans (if any). The CSRD will require third-party assurances, including integration into the auditor’s report, a requirement not covered by the NFRD. This information will be required to be presented in a company’s annual financial reports, not in a separate sustainability report. Assurances can at first be ""limited"" but must reach the threshold of ""reasonable"" assurances by 2028. For those of you out there who are not accountants (good for you), reasonable assurances amount to an auditor affirming that the information reported is materially correct, while limited assurances simply state that the auditor is not aware of any material modifications that need to be made. The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) is drafting the upcoming EU Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) that the CSRD will adopt as its reporting standard. The European Commission is due to adopt the initial ESRS standards in mid-2023. If all of this sounds like a lot of work, you are right. If all of this sounds like a lot of work and a little bit intimidating if you are not a European company used to European regulation, accounting and disclosure standards, you are right again. Companies outside the EU that will be subject to CSRD reporting have realized the daunting task ahead of them. Those ahead of the curve have already started the process of adjustment to the CSRD landscape.Chris Librie, senior director of ESG at Applied Materials, acknowledged that CSRD will require companies outside the EU to change their perspective on sustainability. ""CSRD is pretty comprehensive,"" Librie said. ""It involves double materiality, which may bring into scope things that we may not have considered. For example, we haven’t traditionally looked at biodiversity, but that may come up."" Most companies will need to expand their ability to measure and manage sustainability issues in their own operations; as well down their supply chains to comply with CSRD disclosure rules.""Our ESG team is fairly small,"" Librie said, ""so we will be reaching to other divisions such as human resources, environmental health and safety and others, as well as our outside auditors and consultants.

### assistant:The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is a policy adopted by the European Union with the goal of steering economic and investment activity towards more sustainable outcomes by improving corporate sustainability reporting. It replaces the previous Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). Unlike NFRD, CSRD covers nearly 50,000 companies including approximately 10,000 firms located outside of the EU. It requires these companies to enhance their reporting around sustainability. Furthermore, CSRD aims to provide investors and businesses with more timely, consistent, and comparable sustainability information. The new rules apply to public and private businesses satisfying two of several specific criteria. By January 1, 2025, firms have to present their first report aligning with CSRD. Smaller and medium-sized entities and companies conducting business in the EU from outside the continent will also be affected by the new rules. Additionally, these rules demand more detailed information related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues and require companies to set ESG targets annually and to report on their progress in achieving these targets. Unlike NFRD, the CSRD will require third-party assurances, including an auditor’s verification that the reported information is materially correct. The implementing organization, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, is expected to draft the new EU Sustainability Reporting Standards to be adopted by the CSRD by mid-2023. This news was reported by GreenBiz on May 1, 2023."

Those for whom this reporting will be new, including companies outside the EU, have until 2025 to begin complying.The NFRD was never mandatory. As a result, investors, regulators and civil society groups were often frustrated with the lack of sustainability-related information from companies and the lack of comparability of that data. The European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) recently released an implementation appraisal on the NFRD that highlighted many shortcomings of the NFRD: The purpose of the CSRD is to provide investors and businesses with more information about the sustainability of companies operating in the EU, that is timely, consistent and comparable.The rules will cover both public and private business that satisfy two of the following criteria: Compliance with CSRD isn’t that far away.

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is the latest European Union policy targeting economic and investment activity to encourage more sustainable outcomes, reported by GreenBiz on 1st May 2023. Essentially replacing the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), CSRD now mandates nearly 50,000 companies to enhance their reporting around sustainability. This directive applies to businesses both within and outside the EU. The companies already under NFRD need to comply with CSRD starting 2024, and the rest including those outside the EU have until 2025. The CSRD aims to provide investors and businesses with more insightful, consistent and comparable information about sustainability practices within EU operating companies. It is considered the de facto sustainability disclosure regulation set to influence global companies, especially those doing significant business in Europe. Businesses need to submit their first report in alignment with CSRD by 1st January 2025. Additionally, the CSRD will require third-party assurances, a requirement not covered by the NFRD. This information should be included in a company's annual financial reports; assurances can initially be ""limited"" but must reach the threshold of ""reasonable"" assurances by 2028. The EU Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), to be adopted by the CSRD as its reporting standard, is being drafted by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) and expected to be adopted by the European Commission in mid-2023."

Those for whom this reporting will be new, including companies outside the EU, have until 2025 to begin complying.The NFRD was never mandatory. As a result, investors, regulators and civil society groups were often frustrated with the lack of sustainability-related information from companies and the lack of comparability of that data. The European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) recently released an implementation appraisal on the NFRD that highlighted many shortcomings of the NFRD: The purpose of the CSRD is to provide investors and businesses with more information about the sustainability of companies operating in the EU, that is timely, consistent and comparable.The rules will cover both public and private business that satisfy two of the following criteria: Compliance with CSRD isn’t that far away. Companies that meet the reporting requirements will have to submit their first report of aligning with CSRD by Jan. 1, 2025. Smaller and medium-sized entities (SMEs) won’t have to comply with the rules until January 2026. Companies outside of Europe that do business in the EU will also be covered by the new rules — companies that generate total revenue of $167 million  in the EU and have at least one branch or subsidiary in the EU with more than $44.51 million in net revenue will be required to comply with the new disclosure requirements. In essence, the CSRD is becoming the de facto sustainability disclosure regulation for large global companies; as companies with significant business in Europe will have to adhere to the rules Europe sets down. The hope of European regulators — and sustainability-minded professionals around the world — is that this higher disclosure bar will export European best practices in disclosure globally. As large companies in global markets are forced to raise their standards, these disclosure standards will cause other companies in those markets to follow the more stringent disclosure standards set by the EU in order to keep up with best practices.In addition to information already required by the NFRD, companies that comply with the CSRD will have to publish information related to: Companies will be required to set annual ESG targets and report their process hitting these targets, including transition plans (if any). The CSRD will require third-party assurances, including integration into the auditor’s report, a requirement not covered by the NFRD. This information will be required to be presented in a company’s annual financial reports, not in a separate sustainability report. Assurances can at first be ""limited"" but must reach the threshold of ""reasonable"" assurances by 2028. For those of you out there who are not accountants (good for you), reasonable assurances amount to an auditor affirming that the information reported is materially correct, while limited assurances simply state that the auditor is not aware of any material modifications that need to be made. The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) is drafting the upcoming EU Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) that the CSRD will adopt as its reporting standard. The European Commission is due to adopt the initial ESRS standards in mid-2023. If all of this sounds like a lot of work, you are right. If all of this sounds like a lot of work and a little bit intimidating if you are not a European company used to European regulation, accounting and disclosure standards, you are right again. Companies outside the EU that will be subject to CSRD reporting have realized the daunting task ahead of them. Those ahead of the curve have already started the process of adjustment to the CSRD landscape.Chris Librie, senior director of ESG at Applied Materials, acknowledged that CSRD will require companies outside the EU to change their perspective on sustainability. ""CSRD is pretty comprehensive,"" Librie said. ""It involves double materiality, which may bring into scope things that we may not have considered. For example, we haven’t traditionally looked at biodiversity, but that may come up."" Most companies will need to expand their ability to measure and manage sustainability issues in their own operations; as well down their supply chains to comply with CSRD disclosure rules.""Our ESG team is fairly small,"" Librie said, ""so we will be reaching to other divisions such as human resources, environmental health and safety and others, as well as our outside auditors and consultants. The number of potential topics are so many that we are taking a team approach to develop a structured approach to the CSRD process.""The race is on to train financial professionals for the transition. Several organizations are working with companies to help them prepare for the transition. One of these is Accounting for Sustainability (A4S) . A4S was established by King Charles III in 2004, with the aim of working with chief financial officers and other financial leaders to drive a shift towards more sustainable business models. A4S routinely hosts workshops to share best practices and build knowledge of financial professionals to bring them up to speed. Brad Sparks, executive director of A4S Foundation U.S.,  emphasized how A4S is seeing significant interest from finance and accounting professionals that A4S works with around CSRD.""CSRD has become part of the reporting workshops that we host,"" Sparks said. ""We also started a new controllers forum and had a meeting earlier this year where we brought in someone from EFRAG to discuss the emerging ESRS standards. The forum is designed for chief accounting officers, controllers and ESG controllers to exchange insights, challenges and responses to sustainability issues among peers. Our initial meeting had a focus on double materiality — a topic that is new to many in the finance and accounting community.""Part of the learning curve for those outside the EU will be navigating the differences in accounting standards, investor expectations and legal systems that underpin EU regulation and norms outside the EU. ""Finance and accounting professionals in the United States are seeking additional guidance to help with the emerging standards,"" Sparks said. ""In general, global accounting standards are typically principles-based, while U.S. accounting (GAAP) is typically rules-based. This is similar with the ESRS following a more principles-based approach, which some in the U.S. view as more challenging to implement."" Although adjusting to a CSRD world will take time and resources, in the end, the goal is to provide investors, policymakers, civil society and companies themselves with better information. It may move sustainability reporting more to the mainstream, which has both positive and negative implications.  Preparing for CSRD reporting will be a step change in managing and measuring sustainability data for many companies outside the EU. Companies that need to report under the CSRD standard will need to start now if they haven’t already: January 2025 isn’t that far away. There are steps companies can take to get ready. Here are just a few places to start:""I see this possibly driving companies toward more integrated reporting,"" Librie said. ""I think ultimately we will see more 10-Ks and sustainability reports that merge, so we will have a one-stop shop for all this information. That is a positive but a potential negative is that in a 10-K type document, you can’t be as verbose. You have to be more economical about telling your story, and that might make ESG engagement more challenging."" ""Companies are seeking to understand how they can comply with reporting requirements in an effective, efficient and impactful manner,"" Sparks said. ""They want to understand what best practices are and are looking for more guidance."" Sparks noted that A4S plans to hold more workshops around CSRD in the future, as it sees increasing demand from the CFOs and financial professionals they meet with.","### human: 
What is the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in Europe and what are its implications for companies both within and outside of the EU?
### assistant:'
The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is a policy by the European Union (EU) aimed at moving economic and investment activities toward more sustainable outcomes. It is set to replace the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and will require roughly 50,000 companies, including about 10,000 outside the EU, to enhance their reporting around sustainability. The CSRD is intended to provide investors and businesses with timely, consistent, and comparable information about the sustainability of companies operating in the EU. It will also cover businesses that satisfy two out of the three criteria: apply to an EU supervisory authority for an evaluation of equivalence; generate total revenue of $167 million in the EU; and have at least one branch or subsidiary in the EU with more than $44.51 million in net revenue. The first report aligning with CSRD must be submitted by Jan. 1, 2025. Smaller and medium-sized entities (SMEs) and companies outside Europe that do business in the EU have until January 2026 to comply. The directive is expected to serve as a de facto sustainability disclosure regulation for large global companies, hopefully exporting European best practices in disclosure globally. Notably, the requirement calls for annual ESG targets and third-party assurances. That includes integration into the auditor’s report, a requirement not covered by the NFRD. Companies outside the EU that will be subject to CSRD reporting are expected to change their perspective on sustainability significantly. The details were reported by GreenBiz on April 30, 2023."

640b5418ae3f060ada31d687,ThreeBLMedia,Carbon Emissions,Semiconductor Industry Sustainability Priorities – A Systems Engineering Opportunity,https://www.3blmedia.com/news/semiconductor-industry-sustainability-priorities-systems-engineering-opportunity,2023-03-10,ThreeBLMedia,"Reducing emissions and optimizing resources in semiconductor manufacturing is an immensely complex undertaking, with multiple moving parts and several cascading impacts. While semiconductors are key to enabling a sustainable future, fabricating those chips is a notoriously resource-intensive process. Consider: a single fabrication plant can consume up to 10 million gallons of water a day, as much electricity as what's needed to power 50,000 homes daily, and, over the course of a year, generate  60,000 tons of waste.An industry-wide consensus has emerged around the importance of driving sustainable practices into semiconductor production, especially as the industry is poised for further growth in the years ahead. Moreover, individual companies are stepping up to do their part. As outlined in our most recent Sustainability Report , Applied Materials has made significant progress in reducing our carbon footprint and powering our operations increasingly with renewable energy. Other industry players are taking similar actions to reduce their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (those produced by a company and the energy it consumes). Yet, as an industry we need to take these efforts to the next level. Decarbonization requires a concerted and collective effort to reduce Scope 3 emissions – those generated across a company’s entire value chain. And this is where things get complicated because it involves working with industry partners, suppliers, and customers to define levels and sources of emissions being generated beyond the control of any individual entity. The issue then becomes one of defining the actions that are most likely to have a meaningful and measurable impact.High Value Problem The stakes involved couldn’t be higher. Advancing decarbonization is critical to the future of the semiconductor industry and, ultimately, to the future of the planet. Indeed, in systems engineering terms, it’s perhaps the most significant high-value problem you can imagine. The good news is we are systems engineers. In our industry, we apply our skills, talents, and methodologies to fuel unprecedented advances and innovation in semiconductor capabilities. These same qualities are needed to untangle the multi-layered complexities involved in creating a more sustainable industry. Specifically, a systems engineering mindset can define the cause-and-effect linkages that tie short-term actions to long-term collective goals. These linkages provide the foundation for the essential task of tracking progress over time and holding individual stakeholders accountable throughout the journey. Outlined here are three priority areas where – individually as companies, and collectively as an industry – systems engineering practices can move the decarbonization needle in the right direction.1. More Efficient Products and Production Processes Decarbonization starts with each company reducing environmental impact through more efficient processes and greater reliance on clean sources of energy. But this goes beyond each company merely taking responsibility for its own footprint. Specifically, the upstream and downstream effects of production practices must be considered. When calculating a company’s Scope 3 emissions, the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol includes the lifetime emissions generated by the use of products by end users. In Applied’s case, these are the emissions that result from the energy and chemicals required to power our equipment at customers’ fabs over the full product lifespan. Applied’s analysis of Scope 3 emissions illustrates the impact of product usage – and the extent to which we are all in this together. Based on our 2019 baseline, we estimate that Use of Sold Products (Category 11 in the GHG Protocol) accounts for about 80 percent of Applied’s total Scope 3 impact for our semiconductor products (see chart below). As such, we have a powerful mutual interest in improving our own practices, as well as working with our customers to help them improve theirs. Put simply, “not my problem” is not an option.Meanwhile, a collaborative approach – particularly where systems engineers are involved – can have a meaningful impact. Applied’s iSystem™ platform leverages intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities to enhance energy efficiency without impacting production output, and has helped improve efficiencies, reduce emissions and lower energy consumption for chipmakers such as TSMC . The platform’s “energy-saving mode” enables demand-based consumption of electricity by synchronizing energy needs to operation.2. Grid Decarbonization Innovative technology solutions enabling more efficient production processes and practices that reduce energy consumption address the demand side of the equation at the fab. Nonetheless, even the most energy-efficient fabs will still require massive amounts of electricity. As such, grid decarbonization is essential to significant and sustainable emissions reduction. As an industry, we need to invest in scaling renewable forms of energy such as wind and solar, and evaluate other carbon-free energy sources and storage methods. Advocacy, meanwhile, needs to focus on smarter practices – such as ensuring that new fabrication facilities are located in areas supplied by higher amounts of renewable energy and that can accommodate demands for massive amounts of water. In determining the location of new fabs, a systems engineering perspective must be included in decisions traditionally made by economic development authorities and politicians.3. Enhance Supplier Practices Systems engineering expertise can also be applied to enhance supplier practices. The opportunity is significant, as Purchased Goods and Services (Category 1) represent about 15 percent of Applied’s estimated Scope 3 emissions and are the second largest contributor to our footprint. Here, engineers can help procurement teams define emissions-focused metrics and criteria used to select and evaluate suppliers. Contractual clauses that provide financial incentives for suppliers to invest in new technologies or to develop new processes that reduce emissions can be a powerful tool to prioritize sustainable practices. Engineers have the knowledge needed to identify the areas that, for suppliers, are most attractive from a business standpoint, and that will have the most significant environmental impact. For example, IoT initiatives that leverage smart sensors and networks of connected devices can monitor energy requirements, optimize consumption, and document savings.

While semiconductors are key to enabling a sustainable future, fabricating those chips is a notoriously resource-intensive process. Consider: a single fabrication plant can consume up to 10 million gallons of water a day, as much electricity as what's needed to power 50,000 homes daily, and, over the course of a year, generate  60,000 tons of waste.An industry-wide consensus has emerged around the importance of driving sustainable practices into semiconductor production, especially as the industry is poised for further growth in the years ahead. Moreover, individual companies are stepping up to do their part. As outlined in our most recent Sustainability Report , Applied Materials has made significant progress in reducing our carbon footprint and powering our operations increasingly with renewable energy. Other industry players are taking similar actions to reduce their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (those produced by a company and the energy it consumes). Yet, as an industry we need to take these efforts to the next level. Decarbonization requires a concerted and collective effort to reduce Scope 3 emissions – those generated across a company’s entire value chain. And this is where things get complicated because it involves working with industry partners, suppliers, and customers to define levels and sources of emissions being generated beyond the control of any individual entity. The issue then becomes one of defining the actions that are most likely to have a meaningful and measurable impact.High Value Problem The stakes involved couldn’t be higher. Advancing decarbonization is critical to the future of the semiconductor industry and, ultimately, to the future of the planet. Indeed, in systems engineering terms, it’s perhaps the most significant high-value problem you can imagine. The good news is we are systems engineers. In our industry, we apply our skills, talents, and methodologies to fuel unprecedented advances and innovation in semiconductor capabilities. These same qualities are needed to untangle the multi-layered complexities involved in creating a more sustainable industry. Specifically, a systems engineering mindset can define the cause-and-effect linkages that tie short-term actions to long-term collective goals. These linkages provide the foundation for the essential task of tracking progress over time and holding individual stakeholders accountable throughout the journey. Outlined here are three priority areas where – individually as companies, and collectively as an industry – systems engineering practices can move the decarbonization needle in the right direction.1. More Efficient Products and Production Processes Decarbonization starts with each company reducing environmental impact through more efficient processes and greater reliance on clean sources of energy. But this goes beyond each company merely taking responsibility for its own footprint. Specifically, the upstream and downstream effects of production practices must be considered. When calculating a company’s Scope 3 emissions, the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol includes the lifetime emissions generated by the use of products by end users. In Applied’s case, these are the emissions that result from the energy and chemicals required to power our equipment at customers’ fabs over the full product lifespan. Applied’s analysis of Scope 3 emissions illustrates the impact of product usage – and the extent to which we are all in this together. Based on our 2019 baseline, we estimate that Use of Sold Products (Category 11 in the GHG Protocol) accounts for about 80 percent of Applied’s total Scope 3 impact for our semiconductor products (see chart below). As such, we have a powerful mutual interest in improving our own practices, as well as working with our customers to help them improve theirs. Put simply, “not my problem” is not an option.Meanwhile, a collaborative approach – particularly where systems engineers are involved – can have a meaningful impact. Applied’s iSystem™ platform leverages intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities to enhance energy efficiency without impacting production output, and has helped improve efficiencies, reduce emissions and lower energy consumption for chipmakers such as TSMC . The platform’s “energy-saving mode” enables demand-based consumption of electricity by synchronizing energy needs to operation.2. Grid Decarbonization Innovative technology solutions enabling more efficient production processes and practices that reduce energy consumption address the demand side of the equation at the fab. Nonetheless, even the most energy-efficient fabs will still require massive amounts of electricity. As such, grid decarbonization is essential to significant and sustainable emissions reduction. As an industry, we need to invest in scaling renewable forms of energy such as wind and solar, and evaluate other carbon-free energy sources and storage methods. Advocacy, meanwhile, needs to focus on smarter practices – such as ensuring that new fabrication facilities are located in areas supplied by higher amounts of renewable energy and that can accommodate demands for massive amounts of water. In determining the location of new fabs, a systems engineering perspective must be included in decisions traditionally made by economic development authorities and politicians.3. Enhance Supplier Practices Systems engineering expertise can also be applied to enhance supplier practices. The opportunity is significant, as Purchased Goods and Services (Category 1) represent about 15 percent of Applied’s estimated Scope 3 emissions and are the second largest contributor to our footprint. Here, engineers can help procurement teams define emissions-focused metrics and criteria used to select and evaluate suppliers. Contractual clauses that provide financial incentives for suppliers to invest in new technologies or to develop new processes that reduce emissions can be a powerful tool to prioritize sustainable practices. Engineers have the knowledge needed to identify the areas that, for suppliers, are most attractive from a business standpoint, and that will have the most significant environmental impact. For example, IoT initiatives that leverage smart sensors and networks of connected devices can monitor energy requirements, optimize consumption, and document savings. In addition, such solutions continually collect and analyze data to yield new insights that can inform ongoing improvements. Here again, an engineering perspective can ensure that initiatives find the sweet spot that enhances business results as well as achieves sustainability goals.Systems engineering thinking can build the foundation needed to define priorities, develop innovative solutions that drive measurable gains and build momentum for continued progress. Cooperation is essential – our company is just one component of a complex ecosystem, where independent actions are inherently limited. Prospects for cooperation, meanwhile, are bright.

What steps is the semiconductor industry taking towards reducing emissions and optimizing resources in their manufacturing process?

### assistant:'
Semiconductor manufacturing is a complex process with a significant environmental impact on water use, electricity, and waste generation. To address this, the industry is working on driving sustainable practices into their production process. Companies such as Applied Materials are reducing their carbon footprints and increasing their reliance on renewable energy, with similar actions being taken by other industry players to reduce their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. However, they aim to make more significant strides towards decarbonization and are exploring ways to reduce Scope 3 emissions, those generated across a company's entire value chain. This involves collective effort from industry partners, customers, and suppliers.

The focus areas include making more efficient products and production processes, fostering grid decarbonization and improving supplier practices. For instance, Applied Materials is leveraging intelligent IoT capabilities to enhance energy efficiency at its customers' fabrication facilities while advocating for grid decarbonization to achieve sustainable emissions reduction. Additionally, there is a push towards optimizing supplier practices, with engineers helping to devise emission-focused metrics for the selection and evaluation of suppliers.

Say what you want about having modern lexicon in the puzzles — I’m all for it — but I would hate to see these older entries disappear completely, especially because the ones in Mr. Nediger’s puzzle are all things we should still know. I mean, who doesn’t love CINNAMON TOAST?In Mr. Nediger’s puzzle, beside that delectable breakfast treat, the entries that are making a comeback include the Hindu hand gestures called MUDRAs, AMATEUR NIGHT, TOOL SET, LINNAEUS and BIOLOGIST. None of these lovely entries have appeared in the New York Times Crossword since the 1970s, and some of them have not been used since the 1950s.13A. This “Late show?” is not about late night television. It’s referring to DREAMing.17A. If you were wondering why “in England?” was added to “Overcast skies, in England,” it’s because this is actually a language clue. Overcast skies are “gray,” which is the spelling in the United States. In England, however, the spelling is GREY, and that’s what the puzzle was looking for.22A. One issue I had with Mr. Nediger’s puzzle was that a few of the clues required guesswork and filling in the crossings in order to get to the answers. Ultimately, I was able to solve them, which is what counts. And it’s Friday, so solvers are not going to get the help they rely on earlier in the week. But I still believe that if you do not know how numbers are written in Chinese (the clue is nonspecific — I’m not sure if numbers are written the same way in all Chinese dialects), as in the three-letter slot at 22A, you will either have to guess between “one,” “two,” six” and “ten,” or work the crossings. Possibly both.But at least now I know how to write the number TEN in some Chinese dialect.47A. The phrase I DIG comes up quite a bit in the New York Times Crossword — this is its 43rd appearance — but I’m wondering how many younger solvers can get from “‘Gotcha’” to I DIG, an outdated phrase. It is still used, though, so this is one of those “it doesn’t hurt to know some stuff that was popular before you were born” clues.48A. Today I Learned (TIL) the real meaning of the British slang word TOFF. I used to think that because it sounded a bit like the word “tough,” it meant someone who was rough around the edges. TOFF is actually a derogatory word for someone who is upper class. It is believed to have come from “tuft,” a gold tassel worn by titled undergraduates at Oxford and Cambridge.For those who appreciate visual learning, here is what a bunch of TOFFs looks like.5D. This was my favorite clue. “Event that might include poetry, but not pros?” is so clever. It’s easy to have read the last word as “prose.” The clue is really looking for an event where no one is a pro, and that is AMATEUR NIGHT.7D. Another very clever clue. “Subway fare?” could be the money you need to ride the train, but with the question mark, we need to think about what else “Subway” and “fare” might mean. In this puzzle, the clue refers to a sandwich you can buy at Subway, and that is a HERO.Submitting a puzzle with a three-letter entry that’s never been used in The Times, especially an acronym, is always a dicey proposition, so I’m glad to be able to debut HRT in this puzzle.I’m grateful as always to the editors for introducing some great clues, and for keeping the extremely corny dad joke in my clue for AMATEUR NIGHT.The New York Times Crossword has an open submission system, and you can submit your puzzles online.For tips on how to get started, read our series, “How to Make a Crossword Puzzle.”Almost finished solving but need a bit more help?

If you were wondering why “in England?” was added to “Overcast skies, in England,” it’s because this is actually a language clue. Overcast skies are “gray,” which is the spelling in the United States. In England, however, the spelling is GREY, and that’s what the puzzle was looking for.22A. One issue I had with Mr. Nediger’s puzzle was that a few of the clues required guesswork and filling in the crossings in order to get to the answers. Ultimately, I was able to solve them, which is what counts. And it’s Friday, so solvers are not going to get the help they rely on earlier in the week. But I still believe that if you do not know how numbers are written in Chinese (the clue is nonspecific — I’m not sure if numbers are written the same way in all Chinese dialects), as in the three-letter slot at 22A, you will either have to guess between “one,” “two,” six” and “ten,” or work the crossings. Possibly both.But at least now I know how to write the number TEN in some Chinese dialect.47A. The phrase I DIG comes up quite a bit in the New York Times Crossword — this is its 43rd appearance — but I’m wondering how many younger solvers can get from “‘Gotcha’” to I DIG, an outdated phrase. It is still used, though, so this is one of those “it doesn’t hurt to know some stuff that was popular before you were born” clues.48A. Today I Learned (TIL) the real meaning of the British slang word TOFF. I used to think that because it sounded a bit like the word “tough,” it meant someone who was rough around the edges. TOFF is actually a derogatory word for someone who is upper class. It is believed to have come from “tuft,” a gold tassel worn by titled undergraduates at Oxford and Cambridge.For those who appreciate visual learning, here is what a bunch of TOFFs looks like.5D. This was my favorite clue. “Event that might include poetry, but not pros?” is so clever. It’s easy to have read the last word as “prose.” The clue is really looking for an event where no one is a pro, and that is AMATEUR NIGHT.7D. Another very clever clue. “Subway fare?” could be the money you need to ride the train, but with the question mark, we need to think about what else “Subway” and “fare” might mean. In this puzzle, the clue refers to a sandwich you can buy at Subway, and that is a HERO.Submitting a puzzle with a three-letter entry that’s never been used in The Times, especially an acronym, is always a dicey proposition, so I’m glad to be able to debut HRT in this puzzle.I’m grateful as always to the editors for introducing some great clues, and for keeping the extremely corny dad joke in my clue for AMATEUR NIGHT.The New York Times Crossword has an open submission system, and you can submit your puzzles online.For tips on how to get started, read our series, “How to Make a Crossword Puzzle.”Almost finished solving but need a bit more help?

### assistant: 
The professional crossword constructor and question writer for national quiz bowls who recently published his 44th puzzle for The New York Times is Will Nediger. The puzzle by Nediger is impressive due to its artful blending of both new and older fill, with six entries making their debuts and six others that have not appeared in the crossword since before Will Shortz became editor in 1993. The new entries include phrases like ""I CAN'T LOOK,"" ""BURNER ACCOUNT,"" ""ROOKIE MISTAKE,"" ""LIFE HACKS,"" ""HRT"" (an initialism for hormone replacement therapy), and ""DISCO ANTHEMS."" While entries making a comeback include ""CINNAMON TOAST"" and words like ""MUDRAs,"" ""AMATEUR NIGHT,"" ""TOOL SET,"" ""LINNAEUS"" and ""BIOLOGIST"" (The New York Times, October 28, 2022).

Demand was so strong — and U.S. dependence on a foreign manufacturer so worrying — that Democrats and Republicans agreed in July on a $52 billion subsidy package that included grants to build new chip factories in America.U.S. chip makers such as Intel, Micron Technology, Texas Instruments and GlobalFoundries pledged huge expansions in domestic manufacturing, betting on a growing need for their products and the prospects of federal subsidies.But lately, supplies of some semiconductors are piling up, which could spell good news for consumers but not for industry executives. Their bold investment plans are running into a sudden and unexpected slowdown in consumer demand for electronic gadgets, new U.S. restrictions on sales to customers in China, rising inflation and the unusual prospect of a simultaneous shortage of some chips and glut of others.That has left chip makers, which had been looking ahead to immense demand and opportunity, suddenly grappling with immense challenges. Many of the companies now face complex questions about whether and when to boost production, amid uncertainty about how long the current sales slowdown may last.“Six months ago, I would have said we were in this hypergrowth phase,” Rene Haas, chief executive of Arm, the British company whose chip technology powers billions of smartphones, said of the broader industry. Now, he said, “we’re in a pause.”For many consumers, products that were scarce because of a chips shortage may start becoming more available, though not immediately. Automakers, which have struggled to make enough cars with the lack of chips and other components, said they were getting more but still face some problems. Prices of smartphones and computers could also fall as chip supplies grow and prices plummet for two types of memory chips they use.But for now, not everyone is able to get all the chips they need, and prices remain high for many kinds of semiconductors. “We are still way above prepandemic pricing,” said Frank Cavallaro, chief executive of A2 Global Electronics and Solutions, a chip distributor.Fears of a slump, which have clobbered semiconductor stocks this year, are evident in recent earnings announcements from chip makers. South Korea’s SK Hynix on Wednesday reported a 20 percent drop in revenue and said its business of memory chips “is facing an unprecedented deterioration in market conditions.” Intel provided more evidence of a downturn in its third-quarter results on Thursday, including a 20 percent drop in revenue and a $664 million charge to cover cost-cutting measures expected to include job cuts.The Biden administration delivered its own blow this month with sweeping restrictions aimed at hobbling China from using U.S. technology related to chips. The measures restrict sales of some advanced chips to Chinese customers and prevent U.S. companies from helping China develop some kinds of chips.That hurts semiconductor companies like Nvidia, which makes graphics chips used to run A.I. applications in China and elsewhere. The Silicon Valley company, already suffering from a sharp sales decline for video game applications, recently estimated that the U.S. restrictions would probably reduce revenues in its current quarter by about $400 million.The sanctions may bite even harder at companies that sell chip-making equipment, which relied heavily in recent years on sales to Chinese factories.Lam Research, which produces tools that etch silicon wafers to make chips, estimated that the China limitations would reduce its 2023 revenue by $2 billion to $2.5 billion. “We lost some very profitable customers in the China region, and that’s going to persist,” Doug Bettinger, Lam’s chief financial officer, said during an earnings call last week.Applied Materials, the biggest maker of chip manufacturing tools, also said sales would suffer because of the restrictions. On Wednesday, another maker of chip manufacturing tools, KLA, said its revenue next year was likely to shrink by $600 million to $900 million as it reduces equipment sales and services to some customers in China.Worries about foreign competition are nothing new in semiconductors, an industry known for boom-and-bust cycles. But it has rarely faced a player as potent as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, whose factories on the island churn out chips designed by companies including Apple, Amazon, Nvidia and Qualcomm.China claims Taiwan as its own territory, creating a potential risk to chip supplies. That helped drive the recent bipartisan support for the U.S. chip legislation, which was heavily pushed by President Biden.He trekked to Ohio last month for the ground breaking of a $20 billion Intel manufacturing campus. On Thursday, President Biden visited a site near Syracuse, N.Y., where Micron has vowed to spend as much as $100 billion over 20 years on a large complex to build memory chips, a project he called “one of the most significant investments in American history.”Those plants will be needed at some point, industry executives said. But they are now grappling with the sudden and sharp decline in chip demand. The problem is particularly acute in processors and memory chips, which perform calculations and store data in personal computers, tablets, smartphones and other devices.Those products were hot commodities as consumers worked from home during the coronavirus pandemic. But that boom has now cooled, with PC sales dropping 15 percent in the third quarter, according to estimates by International Data Corporation. The research firm also predicted that smartphone sales would fall 6.5 percent this year. Demand has been tempered by inflation as well as a lengthy Covid lockdown in China, analysts said.At the same time, inventories of chips piled up. Computer makers spooked by the shortage bought more components than they ended up needing, said Dan Hutcheson, a market researcher at the firm TechInsights. When customer demand dried up, they started slashing orders.“You see multiple issues converging,” said Syed Alam, who leads Accenture’s global high tech consulting practice, including semiconductors.Handel Jones, chief executive at International Business Strategies, predicts that total sales for the chip industry will still grow 9.5 percent this year. But he expects revenue to decline 3.4 percent to $584.5 billion next year. Last year, he had predicted steady yearly growth for the chip industry from 2022 until 2030.Warning signs included Intel’s second-quarter results, which it announced in July. The company posted a rare loss and a 22 percent drop in revenue, blaming its own missteps and customers who cut chip inventories.At Micron, the mood also changed quickly. In May, the company gave bullish presentations at an investor event in San Francisco about long-term demand for its memory chips. By the next month, it was warning of slowing demand and falling chip prices.In September, the company reported a 20 percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue. It also slashed planned spending on factories and equipment by nearly 50 percent in the current fiscal year.The swing in demand might seem to undercut Micron’s widely publicized expansion plans, which include the Syracuse complex and a new $15 billion factory in Boise. But chip manufacturers often juggle different time schedules. Since new factories take roughly three years to complete, waiting too long to build can leave them short-handed when sales rebound.“The long-term outlook for memory and storage is robust,” said Mark Murphy, Micron’s executive vice president and chief financial officer. The cuts in near-term capital spending, he added, are a needed response “to bring our supply in line with demand.”Intel’s situation is even more complex. The company has major factory expansions underway in Arizona, Oregon, New Mexico, Ireland and Israel, in addition to the new manufacturing campus in Ohio and one planned for Germany. Intel is also determined to start competing with T.S.M.C. in manufacturing for other companies, as well as making chips it designs.Intel now plans to construct factory buildings while holding off on purchases of the costly machines inside them, which are a much bigger expense.Those purchases can be tailored to emerging demand for particular kinds of chips, said Keyvan Esfarjani, Intel’s executive vice president who oversees construction and operation of its factories. He said the long-term need to reduce U.S. and European dependence on chips made in Asia was too important to be halted by short-term business cycles.“This is beyond Intel,” Mr. Esfarjani said in an interview last month. “This is important for people, for communities, for the United States. It’s important for national security.”","TheNewYorkTimes: 2022-10-27 A few months ago, makers of computer chips seemed on top of the world.Customers could not get enough of the small slices of silicon, which act as the brains of computers and are needed in just about every device with an on-off switch.

What recent trends have been occurring in the computer chip industry and how have they affected major chip producers?
### assistant:;
In the past few months, computer chip makers have been facing some challenges. First, there is a sudden and unanticipated slow down in consumer demand for electronic gadgets. Additionally, new U.S. restrictions prohibit sales to customers in China, causing a further strain in the industry. Inflation is on the rise and there is an unusual prospect of a simultaneous shortage of some chips and a surplus of others. This situation led US chip makers such as Intel, Micron Technology, Texas Instruments and GlobalFoundries, which had announced a significant expansion in domestic production, now facing issues about whether and when to increase production. This uncertainty is due to the volatile nature of the current sales slowdown.

 These trends resulted in a pile-up of some semiconductor supplies, which could be good for consumers, but not necessarily beneficial for industry executives. Now, makers are grappling with the challenges brought by these conditions and are faced with complex decisions about production. 

Also, the Silicon Valley company, Nvidia, which makes graphics chips, anticipates that the U.S. restrictions may probably reduce revenues in its current quarter by about $400 million. Lam Research, which produces tools that make chips, guesses that the China limitations will decrease its 2023 revenue by $2 to $2.5 billion. At the same time, companies that sell chip-making equipment heavily rely on sales to Chinese factories.

On the bright side, products that were scarce due to a chips shortage may start becoming more available. Prices of smartphones and computers could also fall as chip supplies grow. However, not everyone is able to get all the chips they need, and prices remain high for many kinds of semiconductors (TheNewYorkTimes, 2022-10-27).

The Nikkei newspaper said Apple had planned to use the chips in iPhones sold in China.On 7 October, the Biden administration imposed a sweeping set of export controls that included measures to cut China off from certain semiconductor chips and chip-making equipment.Under the rules, US companies must cease supplying Chinese chipmakers with equipment that can produce relatively advanced chips unless they first obtain a licence.The new regulations also add controls on some semiconductor production items and transactions for specific end-uses of some integrated circuits or chips. The US also wants to increase its export controls to include semiconductor products and software, technology, and other things used to develop and make integrated circuits.

On October 18, 2022, the US took unprecedented steps to limit the sale of advanced computer chips to China in an effort to contain Beijing’s tech and military ambitions. This move is designed to cut off supplies of critical technology to China, which could be used across different sectors including advanced computing and weapons manufacturing. In response to this move, Apple reportedly put on hold plans to use memory chips from China’s Yangtze Memory Technologies in its products. The Biden administration, on October 7, imposed a sweeping set of export controls, cutting off China from certain semiconductor chips and chip-making equipment.

6398d674509dfebce437839f,TheNewYorkTimes,LAM,"With New Crackdown, Biden Wages Global Campaign on Chinese Technology",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/us/politics/biden-china-technology-semiconductors.html?searchResultPosition=35,2022-10-13,Ana Swanson and Edward Wong,"WASHINGTON — In conversations with American executives this spring, top officials in the Biden administration revealed an aggressive plan to counter the Chinese military’s rapid technological advances.China was using supercomputing and artificial intelligence to develop stealth and hypersonic weapons systems, and to try to crack the U.S. government’s most encrypted messaging, according to intelligence reports. For months, administration officials debated what they could do to hobble the country’s progress.They saw a path: The Biden administration would use U.S. influence over global technology and supply chains to try to choke off China’s access to advanced chips and chip production tools needed to power those abilities. The goal was to keep Chinese entities that contributed to potential threats far behind their competitors in the United States and in allied nations.The effort, no less than what the Americans carried out against Soviet industries during the Cold War, gained momentum this year as the United States tested powerful economic tools against Russia as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine, and as China broke barriers in technological development. The Russian offensive and Beijing’s military actions also made the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan seem more real to U.S. officials.The administration’s concerns about China’s tech ambitions culminated last week in the unveiling of the most stringent controls by the U.S. government on technology exports to the country in decades — an opening salvo that would ripple through global commerce and could frustrate other governments and companies outside China.In a speech on Wednesday on the administration’s national security strategy, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, talked about a “small yard, high fence” for critical technologies.“Choke points for foundational technologies have to be inside that yard, and the fence has to be high because these competitors should not be able to exploit American and allied technologies to undermine American and allied security,” he said.This account of how President Biden and his aides decided to wage a new global campaign against China, which contains previously unreported details, is based on interviews with two dozen current and former officials and industry executives. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss deliberations.The measures were particularly notable given the Biden administration’s preference for announcing policies in tandem with allies to counter rival powers, as it did with sanctions against Russia.With China, the administration spent months in discussions with allies, including the Dutch, Japanese, South Korean, Israeli and British governments, and tried to persuade some of them to issue restrictions alongside the United States.But some of those governments have been hesitant to cut off important commerce with China, one of the world’s largest technology markets. So the Biden administration decided to act alone, without public measures from allies.Gregory C. Allen, a former Defense Department official who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the move came after consultation with allies but was “fundamentally unilateral.”“In weaponizing its dominant choke-point positions in the global semiconductor value chain, the United States is exercising technological and geopolitical power on an incredible scale,” he wrote in an analysis.The package of restrictions allows the administration to cut off China from certain advanced chips made by American and foreign companies that use U.S. technology.U.S. officials described the decision to push ahead with export controls as a show of leadership. They said some allies wanted to impose similar measures but feared retaliation from China, so the rules from Washington that encompass foreign companies did the hard work for them.Other rules bar American companies from selling Chinese firms equipment or components needed to manufacture advanced chips, and prohibit Americans and U.S. companies from giving software updates and other services to China’s cutting-edge chip factories.The measures do not directly restrict foreign makers of semiconductor equipment from selling products to China. But experts said the absence of the American equipment would most likely impede China’s nascent industry for making advanced chips. Eventually, though, that leverage could fade as China develops its own key production technologies.Some companies have chafed at the idea of losing sales in a lucrative market. In a call with investors in August, an executive at Tokyo Electron in Japan said the company was “very concerned” that restrictions could prevent its Chinese customers from producing chips. ASML, the Dutch equipment maker, has expressed criticisms.Chinese officials called the U.S. restrictions a significant step aimed at sabotaging their country’s development. The move could have broad implications — for example, limiting advances in artificial intelligence that propel autonomous driving, video recommendation algorithms and gene sequencing, as well as quashing China’s chip-making industry. China could respond by punishing foreign companies with operations there. And the way Washington is imposing the rules could strain U.S. alliances, some experts say.“Sanctions that put the United States at odds with its allies and partners today will both undercut their effectiveness and make it harder to enroll a broad coalition of states in U.S. deterrence efforts,” said Jessica Chen Weiss, a professor of government at Cornell University and a recent State Department official.Others have argued that the moves did not come soon enough. For years, U.S. intelligence reports warned that American technology was feeding China’s efforts to develop advanced weapons and surveillance networks that police its citizens.Last October, the intelligence community began highlighting the risks posed by Chinese advances in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and semiconductors in meetings with industry and government officials.What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source.Mr. Sullivan and other officials began pushing to curb sales of semiconductor technology, according to current and former officials and others familiar with the discussions.But some officials, including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and her deputies, wanted to first secure the cooperation of allies. Starting late last year, they said in meetings that by acting alone, the United States risked harming its companies without doing much to stop Chinese firms from buying important technology from foreign competitors.Even as the Trump administration took some aggressive actions against Chinese technology, like barring international shipments to Huawei, it began quiet diplomacy on semiconductor production equipment. U.S. officials talked with their counterparts in Japan and then the Netherlands — countries where companies make critical tools — on limiting exports to China, said Matthew Pottinger, a deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration.Biden administration officials have continued those talks, but some negotiations have been difficult. U.S. officials spent months trying to persuade the Netherlands to prevent ASML from selling older lithography machines to Chinese semiconductor companies, but they were rebuffed.U.S. officials carried out separate negotiations with South Korea, Taiwan, Israel and Britain on restricting the sale and design of chips.Outside of the diplomacy, there was increasing evidence that a tool the United States had used to restrict China’s access to technology had serious flaws. Under President Donald J. Trump, the United States added hundreds of companies to a so-called entity list that prohibited American companies from selling them sensitive products without a license.But each listing was tied to a specific company name and address, making it relatively easy to evade the restrictions, said Ivan Kanapathy, a former China director for the National Security Council.Current and former U.S. officials suspect the Chinese military and previously sanctioned Chinese companies, including Huawei, have tried to gain access to restricted technology through front companies. Huawei declined to comment.Huawei could soon face additional restrictions: The Federal Communications Commission is expected to vote in the coming weeks on rules that would block the authorization of new Huawei equipment in the United States over national security concerns.Biden officials also believed the restrictions issued by the Trump administration against Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, a major Chinese chip maker known as SMIC, had been watered down by industry and were allowing too many sales to continue, people familiar with the matter said.In a call with heads of American semiconductor equipment makers in March, Mr. Sullivan said that the United States was no longer satisfied with the status quo with China, and that it was seeking to freeze Chinese technology, said one executive familiar with the discussion.Mr. Sullivan, who had dialed into the call alongside Ms. Raimondo and Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, told executives from KLA, Applied Materials and Lam Research that rules restricting equipment shipments to China would be done with allies, the executive said.In a statement, the National Security Council said the measures were “consistent with the message we delivered to U.S. executives because the administration has controlled only tools made by U.S. companies where there is no foreign competitor.”The State Department announced on Thursday that Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, would visit Applied Materials during a two-day trip to California starting Sunday. It said he will tour a “lab producing innovations critical to the supply chain for advanced chips.” Applied Materials said on Wednesday that it is cutting its estimate for fourth-quarter revenues because of the new restrictions on exports to China.As the negotiations with allied governments continued, experts at the Commerce, Defense, Energy and State Departments spent months poring over spreadsheets listing dozens of semiconductor tools made by U.S. companies to determine which could be used for advanced chip production and whether companies in Japan and the Netherlands produced comparable equipment.Then in July came alarming news. A report emerged that SMIC had cleared a major technological hurdle, producing a semiconductor that rivaled some complex chips made in Taiwan.The achievement prompted an explosion of dissatisfaction in the White House and on Capitol Hill with U.S. efforts to restrain China’s technological advancement.The Biden administration took action in August to clamp down on China’s semiconductor industry, sending letters to equipment manufacturers and chip makers barring them from selling certain products to China.Last week, the administration issued the ‌rules with global reach.Companies immediately began halting shipments to China. But U.S. officials said they would issue licenses on a case-by-case basis so some non-Chinese companies could continue supplying their Chinese facilities with support and components. Intel, TSMC, Samsung and SK Hynix said they had received temporary exemptions to the rules.The controls could be the beginning of a broad assault by the U.S. government, Mr. Pottinger said.“The Biden administration understands now that it isn’t enough for America to run faster — we also need to actively hamper the P.R.C.’s ambitions for tech dominance,” he said, referring to the People’s Republic of China. “This marks a serious evolution in the administration’s thinking.”Julian Barnes and David McCabe contributed reporting.","TheNewYorkTimes: 2022-10-13 WASHINGTON — In conversations with American executives this spring, top officials in the Biden administration revealed an aggressive plan to counter the Chinese military’s rapid technological advances.China was using supercomputing and artificial intelligence to develop stealth and hypersonic weapons systems, and to try to crack the U.S. government’s most encrypted messaging, according to intelligence reports.

Friedman,"In case you haven’t noticed, let me alert you to a bracing turn of events: The U.S. is now in conflict with Russia and China at the same time. Grandma always said, “Never fight Russia and China at the same time.” So did Henry Kissinger. Alas, there is a strong case in the national interest for confronting both today. But have no doubt: We are in uncharted waters. I just hope that these are not our new “forever wars.”The struggle with Russia is indirect, but obvious, escalating and violent. We are arming the Ukrainians with smart missiles and intelligence to force the Russians to withdraw from Ukraine. While taking nothing away from the bravery of the Ukrainians, the U.S. and NATO’s support has played a giant role in Ukraine’s battlefield successes. Just ask the Russians. But how does this war end? No one can tell you.Today, though, I want to focus on the struggle with China, which is less visible and involves no shooting, because it is being fought mostly with transistors that toggle between digital 1s and 0s. But it will have as big, if not bigger, an impact on the global balance of power as the outcome of the combat between Russia and Ukraine. And it has little to do with Taiwan.It is a struggle over semiconductors — the foundational technology of the information age. The alliance that designs and makes the smartest chips in the world will also have the smartest precision weapons, the smartest factories and the smartest quantum computing tools to break virtually any form of encryption. Today, the U.S. and its partners lead, but China is determined to catch up — and we are now determined to prevent that. Game on.Last week, the Biden administration issued a new set of export regulations that in effect said to China: “We think you are three technology generations behind us in logic and memory chips and equipment, and we are going to ensure that you never catch up.” Or, as the national security adviser Jake Sullivan put it more diplomatically: “Given the foundational nature of certain technologies, such as advanced logic and memory chips, we must maintain as large of a lead as possible” — forever.“The U.S. has essentially declared war on China’s ability to advance the country’s use of high-performance computing for economic and security gains,” Paul Triolo, a China and tech expert at Albright Stonebridge, a consulting firm, told The Financial Times. Or as the Chinese Embassy in Washington framed it, the U.S. is going for “sci-tech hegemony.”But where does this war end? No one can tell you. I don’t want to be ripped off by a China that is increasingly using technology for absolute control at home and creepy power-projection abroad. But if we are now locked on a path of denying China advanced technologies forever — eliminating any hope of win-win collaborations with Beijing on issues like climate and cybercrime, where we face mutual threats and are the only two powers that can make a difference — what kind of world will that produce? China should be asking the same questions.All I know for sure is that regulations issued Friday by President Biden’s Commerce Department are a formidable new barrier when it comes to export controls that will block China from being able to buy the most advanced semiconductors from the West or the equipment to manufacture them on its own.The new regulations also bar any U.S. engineer or scientist from aiding China in chip manufacturing without specific approval, even if that American is working on equipment in China not subject to export controls. The regs also tighten the tracking to ensure that U.S.-designed chips sold to civilian companies in China don’t get into the hands of China’s military. And, maybe most controversially, the Biden team added a “foreign direct product rule” that, as The Financial Times noted, “was first used by the administration of Donald Trump against Chinese technology group Huawei” and “in effect bars any U.S. or non-U.S. company from supplying targeted Chinese entities with hardware or software whose supply chain contains American technology.”This last rule is huge, because the most advanced semiconductors are made by what I call “a complex adaptive coalition” of companies from America to Europe to Asia. Think of it this way: AMD, Qualcomm, Intel, Apple and Nvidia excel at the design of chips that have billions of transistors packed together ever more tightly to produce the processing power they are seeking. Synopsys and Cadence create sophisticated computer-aided design tools and software on which chip makers actually draw up their newest ideas. Applied Materials creates and modifies the materials to forge the billions of transistors and connecting wires in the chip. ASML, a Dutch company, provides the lithography tools in partnership with, among others, Zeiss SMT, a German company specializing in optical lenses, which draws the stencils on the silicon wafers from those designs, using both deep and extreme ultraviolet light — a very short wavelength that can print tiny, tiny designs on a microchip. Intel, Lam Research, KLA and firms from Korea to Japan to Taiwan also play key roles in this coalition.The point is this: The more we push the boundaries of physics and materials science to cram more transistors onto a chip to get more processing power to continue to advance artificial intelligence, the less likely it is that any one company, or country, can excel at all the parts of the design and manufacturing process. You need the whole coalition. The reason Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, known as TSMC, is considered the premier chip manufacturer in the world is that every member of this coalition trusts TSMC with its most intimate trade secrets, which it then melds and leverages for the benefit of the whole.Because China is not trusted by the coalition partners not to steal their intellectual property, Beijing is left trying to replicate the world’s all-star manufacturing chip stack on its own with old technologies. It managed to pilfer a certain amount of chip technology, including 28 nanometer technology from TSMC back in 2017.Until recently, China’s premier chip maker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Company, had been thought to be stuck at mostly this chip level, although it claims to have produced some chips at the 14 nm and even 7 nm scale by jury-rigging some older-generation Deep UV lithography from ASML. U.S. experts told me, though, that China can’t mass produce these chips with precision without ASML’s latest technology — which is now banned from the country.This week I interviewed U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, who oversees both the new export controls on chips and the $52.7 billion that the Biden administration has just secured to support more U.S. research on next-generation semiconductors and to bring advanced chip manufacturing back to the U.S. Raimondo rejects the idea that the new regulations are tantamount to an act of war.“The U.S. was in an untenable position,” she told me in her office. “Today we are purchasing 100 percent of our advanced logic chips from abroad — 90 percent from TSMC in Taiwan and 10 percent from Samsung in Korea.” (That IS pretty crazy, but it IS true.)“We do not make in the U.S. any of the chips we need for artificial intelligence, for our military, for our satellites, for our space programs” — not to mention myriad nonmilitary applications that power our economy. The recent CHIPS Act, she said, was our “offensive initiative” to strengthen our whole innovation ecosystem so more of the most advanced chips will be made in the U.S.Imposing on China the new export controls on advanced chip-making technologies, she said, “was our defensive strategy. China has a strategy of military-civil fusion,” and Beijing has made clear “that it intends to become totally self-sufficient in the most advanced technologies” to dominate both the civilian commercial markets and the 21st century battlefield. “We cannot ignore China’s intentions.”So, to protect ourselves and our allies — and all the technologies we have invented individually and collectively — she added, “what we did was the next logical step, to prevent China from getting to the next step.” The U.S. and its allies design and manufacture “the most advanced supercomputing chips, and we don’t want them in China’s hands and be used for military purposes.”Our main focus, concluded Raimondo, “is playing offense — to innovate faster than the Chinese. But at the same time, we are going to meet the increasing threat they are presenting by protecting what we need to. It is important that we de-escalate where we can and do business where we can. We don’t want a conflict. But we have to protect ourselves with eyes wide open.”China’s state-directed newspaper Global Times editorialized that the ban would only “strengthen China’s will and ability to stand on its own in science and technology.” Bloomberg quoted an unidentified Chinese analyst as saying “there is no possibility of reconciliation.”Welcome to the future…The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Game on.Last week, the Biden administration issued a new set of export regulations that in effect said to China: “We think you are three technology generations behind us in logic and memory chips and equipment, and we are going to ensure that you never catch up.” Or, as the national security adviser Jake Sullivan put it more diplomatically: “Given the foundational nature of certain technologies, such as advanced logic and memory chips, we must maintain as large of a lead as possible” — forever.“The U.S. has essentially declared war on China’s ability to advance the country’s use of high-performance computing for economic and security gains,” Paul Triolo, a China and tech expert at Albright Stonebridge, a consulting firm, told The Financial Times. Or as the Chinese Embassy in Washington framed it, the U.S. is going for “sci-tech hegemony.”But where does this war end? No one can tell you. I don’t want to be ripped off by a China that is increasingly using technology for absolute control at home and creepy power-projection abroad. But if we are now locked on a path of denying China advanced technologies forever — eliminating any hope of win-win collaborations with Beijing on issues like climate and cybercrime, where we face mutual threats and are the only two powers that can make a difference — what kind of world will that produce? China should be asking the same questions.All I know for sure is that regulations issued Friday by President Biden’s Commerce Department are a formidable new barrier when it comes to export controls that will block China from being able to buy the most advanced semiconductors from the West or the equipment to manufacture them on its own.The new regulations also bar any U.S. engineer or scientist from aiding China in chip manufacturing without specific approval, even if that American is working on equipment in China not subject to export controls. The regs also tighten the tracking to ensure that U.S.-designed chips sold to civilian companies in China don’t get into the hands of China’s military. And, maybe most controversially, the Biden team added a “foreign direct product rule” that, as The Financial Times noted, “was first used by the administration of Donald Trump against Chinese technology group Huawei” and “in effect bars any U.S. or non-U.S. company from supplying targeted Chinese entities with hardware or software whose supply chain contains American technology.”This last rule is huge, because the most advanced semiconductors are made by what I call “a complex adaptive coalition” of companies from America to Europe to Asia. Think of it this way: AMD, Qualcomm, Intel, Apple and Nvidia excel at the design of chips that have billions of transistors packed together ever more tightly to produce the processing power they are seeking. Synopsys and Cadence create sophisticated computer-aided design tools and software on which chip makers actually draw up their newest ideas. Applied Materials creates and modifies the materials to forge the billions of transistors and connecting wires in the chip. ASML, a Dutch company, provides the lithography tools in partnership with, among others, Zeiss SMT, a German company specializing in optical lenses, which draws the stencils on the silicon wafers from those designs, using both deep and extreme ultraviolet light — a very short wavelength that can print tiny, tiny designs on a microchip. Intel, Lam Research, KLA and firms from Korea to Japan to Taiwan also play key roles in this coalition.The point is this: The more we push the boundaries of physics and materials science to cram more transistors onto a chip to get more processing power to continue to advance artificial intelligence, the less likely it is that any one company, or country, can excel at all the parts of the design and manufacturing process. You need the whole coalition. The reason Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, known as TSMC, is considered the premier chip manufacturer in the world is that every member of this coalition trusts TSMC with its most intimate trade secrets, which it then melds and leverages for the benefit of the whole.Because China is not trusted by the coalition partners not to steal their intellectual property, Beijing is left trying to replicate the world’s all-star manufacturing chip stack on its own with old technologies. It managed to pilfer a certain amount of chip technology, including 28 nanometer technology from TSMC back in 2017.Until recently, China’s premier chip maker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Company, had been thought to be stuck at mostly this chip level, although it claims to have produced some chips at the 14 nm and even 7 nm scale by jury-rigging some older-generation Deep UV lithography from ASML. U.S. experts told me, though, that China can’t mass produce these chips with precision without ASML’s latest technology — which is now banned from the country.This week I interviewed U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, who oversees both the new export controls on chips and the $52.7 billion that the Biden administration has just secured to support more U.S. research on next-generation semiconductors and to bring advanced chip manufacturing back to the U.S. Raimondo rejects the idea that the new regulations are tantamount to an act of war.“The U.S. was in an untenable position,” she told me in her office. “Today we are purchasing 100 percent of our advanced logic chips from abroad — 90 percent from TSMC in Taiwan and 10 percent from Samsung in Korea.” (That IS pretty crazy, but it IS true.)“We do not make in the U.S. any of the chips we need for artificial intelligence, for our military, for our satellites, for our space programs” — not to mention myriad nonmilitary applications that power our economy. The recent CHIPS Act, she said, was our “offensive initiative” to strengthen our whole innovation ecosystem so more of the most advanced chips will be made in the U.S.Imposing on China the new export controls on advanced chip-making technologies, she said, “was our defensive strategy. China has a strategy of military-civil fusion,” and Beijing has made clear “that it intends to become totally self-sufficient in the most advanced technologies” to dominate both the civilian commercial markets and the 21st century battlefield. “We cannot ignore China’s intentions.”So, to protect ourselves and our allies — and all the technologies we have invented individually and collectively — she added, “what we did was the next logical step, to prevent China from getting to the next step.” The U.S. and its allies design and manufacture “the most advanced supercomputing chips, and we don’t want them in China’s hands and be used for military purposes.”Our main focus, concluded Raimondo, “is playing offense — to innovate faster than the Chinese. But at the same time, we are going to meet the increasing threat they are presenting by protecting what we need to. It is important that we de-escalate where we can and do business where we can. We don’t want a conflict. But we have to protect ourselves with eyes wide open.”China’s state-directed newspaper Global Times editorialized that the ban would only “strengthen China’s will and ability to stand on its own in science and technology.” Bloomberg quoted an unidentified Chinese analyst as saying “there is no possibility of reconciliation.”Welcome to the future…The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

What is the current state of the US conflicts with Russia and China, and how do they differ?

### assistant: 
As of October 12, 2022, the United States is involved in conflicts with both Russia and China. The U.S. is indirectly in conflict with Russia, escalating and indirectly violent, helping arm Ukrainians with smart missiles and intelligence to force the Russians to withdraw from Ukraine. Meanwhile, the US is involved in a less visible conflict with China, fought mainly over semiconductors. China is determined to catch up to the U.S. and its partners in semiconductor technology, a key driver in information age, and the U.S.' primary strategy is to prevent that. Recently, the Biden administration issued export regulations that will block China's ability to purchase and manufacture the most advanced semiconductors, indicating the U.S.' determination to maintain its lead. However, there is uncertainty about how these conflicts will end. This information is from the New York Times article dated October 12, 2022."

638fcaab3e5c1cbbb0cf2e97,TheNewYorkTimes,Report,Ukrainian Troops Hunt Demoralized Russian Stragglers in Seized City,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-lyman.html?searchResultPosition=768,2022-10-02,,"By Andrew E. Kramer, Michael Schwirtz and Norimitsu OnishiKRAMATORSK, Ukraine — Ukrainian forces on Sunday hunted Russian stragglers in the key city of Lyman, which was taken back from Russia after its demoralized troops, according to a major Russian newspaper, fled with “empty eyes,” and despite Moscow’s baseless claim it had annexed the region surrounding the city.Two days after President Vladimir V. Putin held a grandiose ceremony to commemorate the incorporation of four Ukrainian territories into Russia, the debacle in the city — Lyman, a strategic railway hub in the eastern region of Donbas — ratcheted up pressure on a Russian leadership already facing withering criticism at home for its handling of the war and its conscription of up to 300,000 men into military service.Russia’s retreat from Lyman, which sits on a riverbank that has served as a natural division between the Russian and Ukrainian front lines, came after weeks of fierce fighting.In an unusually candid article published Sunday, the prominent Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported that in the last few days of their occupation, Russian forces in Lyman had been plagued by desertion, poor planning and the delayed arrival of reserves.“The risk of encirclement or shameful imprisonment became too great, and the Russian command made a decision to fall back,” a war correspondent traveling with the fleeing Russian forces wrote, adding that dispirited soldiers with “empty eyes” had barely escaped Lyman with their lives.The retreat is a significant blow to Russian forces that could further undermine the Kremlin’s position in Donbas, a mineral-rich and fertile part of eastern Ukraine that has been central to Mr. Putin’s war aims.Mr. Putin’s office made no public comment about the loss of Lyman, even as pro-war commentators and two of his closest allies sharply criticized the Defense Ministry for retreating from the city. Seemingly unfazed by its military setbacks, Moscow pressed ahead with its annexation effort on Sunday, as the country’s rubber-stamp Constitutional Court formally accepted Mr. Putin’s decision to claim the four Ukrainian regions as part of Russia.But President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine quickly sought to capitalize politically on the retreat, saying it showed that Moscow’s attempt to illegally annex a sizable part of the country was an “absolute farce” and that “now a Ukrainian flag is” in Donbas. But the Ukrainian recoveries in areas Russia now claims have come as Mr. Putin has increasingly hinted at turning to nuclear options in the conflict, alarming American officials.On Friday, after Russian-appointed officials held discredited referendums in the four partly occupied areas of Ukraine, Mr. Putin announced that the territory, including Lyman, would be absorbed into Russia and that its people would be Russian citizens “forever.”Mr. Putin claimed the provinces’ residents had voted overwhelmingly to join the Russian Federation, but Ukraine and its Western allies dismissed the referendums as shams, as most of the citizens had fled the region and many of those left behind had cast ballots at gunpoint.Despite the Russian leader’s claims and bluster at the ceremony on Friday in a grand Kremlin hall — he denounced Washington for “Satanism” — Russian troops retreated from Lyman barely a day later.Initially, Ukrainian commanders thought they would retake Lyman quickly, with forces nearly completely encircling the city. But Russia’s military sent reinforcements. Fierce fighting ensued in dense forests and along the banks of the Siversky Donets River as Ukraine cut off the roads used to move troops and ammunition into the city.“In Lyman and around it, there were significantly strong forces,” Col. Sergei Cherevaty, a spokesman for Ukrainian troops fighting in the east, said in an interview.Russian soldiers retreated chaotically, breaking from their units and escaping in smaller groups into the surrounding forests, Colonel Cherevaty said, and many were killed or captured. About 2,000 to 3,000 Russian soldiers were in Lyman as Ukrainian forces arrived on the outskirts of the city on Friday, he said.As Ukrainian soldiers and police officers fanned out across Lyman to search for Russian stragglers, it was unclear on Sunday how many had fallen into Ukrainian hands.Mr. Zelensky said the city had been fully cleared by Sunday afternoon, as Ukrainian forces conducted patrols and delivered aid to residents who had survived months of Russian occupation and weeks of combat.Artillery strikes have damaged much of Lyman. The city lies largely in ruins, without electricity, water or regular food supplies, according to Stanislav Zagrusky, the police chief of the Kramatorsk District, which includes Lyman.Mr. Zagrusky said in an interview that the resumption of Ukrainian police patrols late on Saturday — hours after the Ukrainian Army declared the city liberated and Russia’s military conceded that it had retreated — underlined the absurdity of the Kremlin’s claim of sovereignty over the four Ukrainian territories.“We absolutely don’t care what they say, what decrees they issue, what announcements they make,” he said of the Kremlin authorities, deploring the conditions in which Russian troops had left residents of Lyman during the occupation: “They did absolutely nothing for the people all this time.”“They didn’t try to restore electricity or water, and people lived without regular food supplies,” he went on, adding that many residents needed medical care.Mr. Zagrusky said that while the Ukrainian military took prisoners after the battle, police officers had made no arrests of Russian stragglers as of midday Sunday. His officers found that Russians had hastily abandoned a police station, leaving it littered with garbage.The police said about 5,000 people remained in the city, which had a prewar population of 20,000.As Ukrainian forces gained full control of Lyman, commanders turned their attention to the next steps in a punishing offensive that has left Russian troops in the eastern Donbas region in an increasingly perilous position.From Lyman, Ukraine could push farther east to try to expel Russian troops from towns and villages they had seized over the summer, though colder temperatures could slow the fighting and Russian lines are expected to be reinforced by newly drafted troops.Military analysts also warn that Ukrainian forces, if they push too far, could become overstretched and unable to defend newly reclaimed territory from Russian counterattacks.None of the four illegally annexed regions are fully under Russian control. Ukrainian gains in the east and south have left the Kremlin’s forces with diminishing options for taking additional territory.In the south, Ukrainian forces are engaged in a fierce counteroffensive in the Kherson region, which Russia seized in the first weeks of the war. Unlike in the northeast, there has been little movement in either direction, though odds increasingly appear to be stacked against Russian forces, the bulk of which have been cut off from their supply lines by successful Ukrainian attacks on key bridges spanning the vast Dnipro River.On the other side of the Dnipro, Russian forces trying to push north in the Zaporizhzhia region, which Mr. Putin also claimed to have annexed, have been held at a standstill for months by strong Ukrainian defensive lines.For now, Russian troops fleeing Lyman appear to be moving to reinforce their lines 25 miles to the south around the city of Bakhmut. That appears to be the only area along the extensive eastern front line where Russian forces are on the offensive, led primarily by members of the Wagner Group, a private military contractor, whose fighters have been pummeling Ukrainian forces for months.“It’s very difficult because they have been hammering for several months with artillery and are constantly attacking with tanks and infantry,” Colonel Cherevaty said. “Holding them is difficult, but they’re managing.”Andrew E.

What recent event occurred in the city of Lyman in relation to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine? 

### assistant:;
Ukrainian forces took back control of the city of Lyman from Russian troops who fled the city. This was a significant blow to Russian forces and could undermine the Kremlin's position in Donbas, a key region in eastern Ukraine. Despite Russian leadership's claims of annexing the region surrounding Lyman, Ukrainian forces manage to reclaim the city. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine emphasized that the retaking of the city was evidence that Moscow's attempt to annex large parts of Ukraine was a ""farce"". As Ukrainian forces now patrol Lyman and deliver aid to civilians, President Zelensky confirms that the city had been fully cleared of Russian soldiers by Sunday afternoon. Artillery strikes have heavily damaged the city and it is left without electricity, water, or regular food supplies. Despite these conditions, about 5,000 people out of a prewar population of 20,000 remain in the city. This news was reported by The New York Times on October 2, 2022."

630dce411e19420c59ea42bd,ThreeBLMedia,Board,Greater Collaboration and Transparency in Reporting Are Key to a More Sustainable Semiconductor Industry,https://www.3blmedia.com/news/greater-collaboration-and-transparency-reporting-are-key-more-sustainable-semiconductor,2022-08-08,Applied Materials,"by Benjamin Gross, Ph.D.\nThe threat posed by climate change is motivating efforts around the world to improve corporate sustainability, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C under the Paris Agreement. According to The Conference Board, 71% of S&P 500 companies publicly report GHG emissions.[1] In recent years, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has become recognized as a major and growing contributor to GHG emissions,[2],[3] which is prompting companies in the industry to declare GHG emissions reduction targets and timelines for achieving net zero emissions. These targets can only be achieved through transparency, cooperation and information sharing; however, there is no universal standard for capturing the relevant metrics. The widely adopted Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) is flexible by design, allowing users to tailor metrics to meet their specific business needs. It bears mentioning that because of this flexibility, GHG Protocol guidelines explicitly state the Scope 3 Protocol is not intended to allow comparison of different companies’ metrics. Given this limitation, there is a need for transparency in how GHG inventories are calculated to give context to stakeholders and enable corporate accountability. This paper provides an overview of the approach Applied Materials takes for a key part of its GHG reporting and its 3x30 initiative’s role in the analysis.\nTracking Sustainability at Applied Materials\nApplied’s 1x – 100x – 10,000x sustainability framework characterizes the environmental impact of its operations, the use of its products, and the products it enables. As part of Applied’s vision to Make Possible® a Better Future, this framework reflects Applied’s view that the company can find outsized environmental benefits if it looks beyond its factory gates for opportunities to reduce GHG emissions.\nAs is the case with many equipment manufacturers, GHG emissions from the use of Applied’s products dwarf the direct emissions from its own operations. By designing more efficient products, Applied can extend its sphere of influence to fulfil its commitment to reduce its environmental impact. To this end, in 2020 Applied launched the 3x30 initiative (part of 100x) with three targets for Applied’s products to reach by the year 2030: (1) a 30% reduction in equivalent energy use, (2) a 30% reduction in the impact of chemical use and (3) a 30% reduction in required cleanroom floorspace.\nThese three targets are measured on a per wafer basis as averaged across Applied’s fleet of products. The metrics used to track progress toward these 3x30 goals incorporate existing standards where appropriate and are compatible with global reporting structures such as the GHG Protocol. The proprietary system-level modeling approach that serves as the main information gathering tool for 3x30 gives Applied a detailed look into product use-phase emissions and allows for a comprehensive summation of the bulk of Applied’s reported GHG emissions.[4]\nGHG Protocol and Scope 3\nThe GHG Protocol, a joint endeavor of the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, is a widely used accounting standard for corporate greenhouse gas emissions. [5] The GHG Protocol assigns GHG emissions to one of three groups: Scope 1 – direct GHG emissions from company-owned or -controlled facilities (such as factories, offices, and vehicles); Scope 2 – indirect emissions from the purchased electrical or heat energy used to power company-owned facilities; and Scope 3 – indirect emissions from a company’s value chain not captured in Scope 1 or 2.\nScope 1 and 2 are relatively straightforward to inventory given their narrow definitions and the control a company has over these emissions sources. The more complicated Scope 3 is split into 15 categories, capturing emissions sources spanning a company’s supply chain and its customers’ activities.\nCustomer use of Applied’s products over their estimated lifetime (Scope 3, Category 11) comprises nearly 80% of Applied’s reported GHG emissions (see Fig. 2). Given the impact of this one category and that Scope 3 analyses require a variety of assumptions and judgements, credibility requires sharing the assessment details of this inventory. Applied’s Scope 3 Category 11 inventory includes the following assumptions:\nEnergy and chemical use are modeled using proprietary software for a toolset that represents the company’s portfolio average.\n1 kWh of electricity use equates to 485g CO2 emissions (estimated global average)\nEstimated average product life is 10 years.\nUtilities (including N2, ultrapure water, compressed dry air, exhaust and cooling water) are included by way of the SEMI S23 [6] standard for converting utilities to “equivalent energy.”\nEmissions from natural gas burned in point-of-use abatement systems are included.\nEstimated equipment operation follows the SEMI S23 standard estimate for equipment availability in a production environment (i.e., 75% Process / 20% Free Time / 5% down time).\nEnergy/utility demand from all required sub-fab equipment is included.\nModeling\nSemiconductor manufacturing tool configurations and wafer process recipes are tailored solutions unique to each customer. In order to avoid the use of sensitive customer information, Applied designates a select mix of tools and models their energy and chemical consumption with its proprietary software which simulates running BKM/middle-of-the-road recipes. These models collectively approximate the fleet average of the tools deployed in the field. These representative data scale with sales information to provide a complete estimate of the product fleet emissions. A team of sustainability engineers works in concert with the product engineering teams to model these representative tools and processes in detail, to provide a baseline against which we measure progress toward our 3x30 goals. The output of these models also provides the estimated emissions under Scope 3 Category 11.\nLifetime\nProduct lifetime is the single biggest variable in defining Scope 3 Category 11. Longer product life is generally a positive attribute for any capital good; but in a seemingly contradictory fashion, it also results in a larger Scope 3 contribution. For example, if Applied assumed a 20-year product life instead of 10, the Scope 3 Category 11 emissions total would double under the GHG Protocol. Also typical for capital assets, extensive refurbishment or modification of semiconductor manufacturing equipment is encouraged to extend its useful life. The resulting system however often resembles a completely different tool running a completely different process. Because of these functional changes and the fact that the tool OEM often does not handle the refurbishment, Applied does not consider the post-refurbishment “second life” as part of its own products’ Scope 3 lifetime. Although most Applied tools that entered production 10 years ago (or even longer) are still in operation, a review of sales and service data shows 10 years to be a useful approximation for a tool’s lifespan prior to refurbishment or major modification.\nIncluding the Sub-Fab\nAll semiconductor manufacturing equipment relies on third-party support equipment such as vacuum pumps, heat-exchangers and point-of-use abatement systems that often reside outside of the cleanroom in an area known as the “sub-fab.” The GHG Protocol does not give specific instructions for the semiconductor manufacturing industry on how to handle sub-fab equipment, but it describes indirect use-phase emissions as “optional” to include (See Fig. 3). Applied takes the position that sub-fab equipment should be included in its inventories because they are only in use to support the Applied systems, and those systems cannot work without the sub-fab equipment. The design of Applied products influences how this support equipment operates, and because of that influence, Applied has a responsibility to account for those emissions. Along these lines, Applied’s iSystem™ product can reduce total fab energy use through optimized use of the sub-fab equipment’s idle or low-power modes.\nUtilities and SEMI S23\nIn addition to process chamber emissions and direct electricity consumption, semiconductor fabs provide utilities, including cooling water, vacuum, ultra-pure water and pressurized clean-dry-air, all of which need energy to deliver and thus can contribute to GHG emissions. Companies across the semiconductor industry recognize the SEMI organization’s S23 Guidelines as the benchmark standard for estimating the energy needed to prepare and deliver these utilities. Converting utility usage into their equivalent energy values helps to highlight opportunities and incentivizes manufacturers to reduce energy use across a fab. For example, if an engineer can enable a tool to require less cooling water, then the fab will consume less energy by avoiding the need to cool the water.\nChemical Emissions\nSemiconductor wafer processing often requires chemicals that are high global-warming-potential (GWP) GHGs, including most notably, fluorine-containing hydrocarbons that can be thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide in their contribution to climate change. The chemical properties of these materials are vital to wafer processing, and in many applications in a fab there are no ideal substitutes available (wafer etching and chamber cleaning, to name a few).\nFortunately, the reactions the materials undergo in wafer processing can result in a large portion of the GHG’s being eliminated, and point-of-use abatement systems are a standard means to destruct much of the remaining high-GWP emissions (often >95%). Applied includes its own post-process chamber emissions data and assumes IPCC default destruction and removal efficiencies (DRE) [7] for abatement in its Scope 3 calculations (see Fig. 4) to accurately model the GHG emissions.\nWhen appropriate, Applied also includes natural gas burned in point-of-use abatement systems, a utility which is not currently included in the S23 Guidelines (see Fig. 3). The remaining post-abatement emissions convert to mass-equivalent CO2 based on the IPCC AR5 GWP100 values [8] and add to the Scope 3 Category 11 total. This approach provides a complete view of the GHG emissions coming directly from the tool (these emissions also contribute to the Scope 1 emissions of the chipmaker).\nSeveral materials commonly used in semiconductor manufacturing have a zero global warming potential, but still have an impact on the environment and should be considered in efforts to improve sustainability. Vapor deposited metals which are mined, refined, and smelted; helium which is extracted from natural gas mining and liquified under intense pressure; silane; and TEOS are all examples of materials consumed in wafer processing with no GWP, and that therefore do not appear in Applied’s Scope 3 Category 11 emissions, consistent with GHG Protocol guidelines.\nThe 3x30 initiative’s metrics include upstream life-cycle-inventory (LCI) data for the input materials to wafer processing, so they do not go unaccounted for by Applied (GHG Protocol captures these emissions in the Scope 3 Category 1 of the chipmaker, but not the equipment maker). Including upstream LCI in Applied’s 3x30 metrics helps to steer process development toward using less material, lower-impact materials, or both, and supports our customers’ efforts toward their own sustainability goals.\nWhat This Means to the Industry\nClear and complete reporting of GHG emissions ensures accountability and helps meaningfully connect actions to results. Guidelines like the GHG Protocol and S23 provide general-purpose frameworks that all semiconductor companies can use and are vital to tracking progress towards a more sustainable industry. Alternatively, sector-specific frameworks like Applied’s 3x30 can be a better option for companies to drive their own business and sustainability goals. In all cases, transparency is key to giving credibility to any reported result, whether using a general standard or a more bespoke reporting structure.\nTo ensure completeness in its accounting, Applied is taking an all-of-the-above approach, using existing standards where available, transparency whenever possible, and developing its own metrics when needed. Despite the variability inherent to Scope 3 accounting, it remains a powerful tool for understanding one’s own indirect emissions that can have outsized impact on a company’s overall footprint, and thus is key to any meaningful efforts to address climate change. Manufacturers should be incentivized to influence the users of their products to reduce energy use and emissions wherever possible, which is what Scope 3 accounting is all about.\nAs chipmakers move to renewable energy, their Scope 2 emissions and Applied’s Scope 3 Category 11 emissions will drop. While it makes sense to acknowledge the changing energy landscape, Applied is not relying on this trend to achieve its sustainability goals. More widely available renewable energy will not preclude the need for the industry as a whole to use energy responsibly and look for ways to grow while reducing net energy usage. By setting the 3x30 energy reduction goals in kWh rather than CO2eq, Applied directly links its sustainability goals with its customers’ efforts to reduce emissions.\nApplied can make its products more efficient, but ultimately it must collaborate with its customers and industry partners to affect large-scale change and enable the achievement of ambitions like net zero targets. Information sharing (and transparency around metrics) will be key to accurate reporting, and many solutions will require co-development between material suppliers, equipment makers and chipmakers. Through such collaboration and transparency Applied is committed to deliver on its promise to Make Possible® a Better Future.\n[1] https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/report-stark-gap-in-climate-disclosures-exists-between-large--small-public-companies-301465038.html\n[2] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/the-chip-industry-has-a-problem-with-its-giant-carbon-footprint\n[3] Proceedings - International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2021-February, 854-867; https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/chasing-carbon-the-elusive-environmental-footprint-of-computing\n[4] https://www.appliedmaterials.com/us/en/blog/blog-posts/adding-sustainability-to-the-definition-of-fab-performance.html\n[5] https://ghgprotocol.org/\n[6] https://store-us.semi.org/products/s02300-semi-s23-guide-for-conservation-of-energy-utilities-and-materials-used-by-semiconductor-manufacturing-equipment\n[7] 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, 6.58, Table 6.17\n[8] https://www.ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/ghgp/Global-Warming-Potential-Values%20%28Feb%2016%202016%29_1.pdf","ThreeBLMedia: 2022-08-08 by Benjamin Gross, Ph.D.\nThe threat posed by climate change is motivating efforts around the world to improve corporate sustainability, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C under the Paris Agreement.

Because of these functional changes and the fact that the tool OEM often does not handle the refurbishment, Applied does not consider the post-refurbishment “second life” as part of its own products’ Scope 3 lifetime. Although most Applied tools that entered production 10 years ago (or even longer) are still in operation, a review of sales and service data shows 10 years to be a useful approximation for a tool’s lifespan prior to refurbishment or major modification.\nIncluding the Sub-Fab\nAll semiconductor manufacturing equipment relies on third-party support equipment such as vacuum pumps, heat-exchangers and point-of-use abatement systems that often reside outside of the cleanroom in an area known as the “sub-fab.” The GHG Protocol does not give specific instructions for the semiconductor manufacturing industry on how to handle sub-fab equipment, but it describes indirect use-phase emissions as “optional” to include (See Fig. 3). Applied takes the position that sub-fab equipment should be included in its inventories because they are only in use to support the Applied systems, and those systems cannot work without the sub-fab equipment. The design of Applied products influences how this support equipment operates, and because of that influence, Applied has a responsibility to account for those emissions. Along these lines, Applied’s iSystem™ product can reduce total fab energy use through optimized use of the sub-fab equipment’s idle or low-power modes.\nUtilities and SEMI S23\nIn addition to process chamber emissions and direct electricity consumption, semiconductor fabs provide utilities, including cooling water, vacuum, ultra-pure water and pressurized clean-dry-air, all of which need energy to deliver and thus can contribute to GHG emissions. Companies across the semiconductor industry recognize the SEMI organization’s S23 Guidelines as the benchmark standard for estimating the energy needed to prepare and deliver these utilities. Converting utility usage into their equivalent energy values helps to highlight opportunities and incentivizes manufacturers to reduce energy use across a fab. For example, if an engineer can enable a tool to require less cooling water, then the fab will consume less energy by avoiding the need to cool the water.\nChemical Emissions\nSemiconductor wafer processing often requires chemicals that are high global-warming-potential (GWP) GHGs, including most notably, fluorine-containing hydrocarbons that can be thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide in their contribution to climate change. The chemical properties of these materials are vital to wafer processing, and in many applications in a fab there are no ideal substitutes available (wafer etching and chamber cleaning, to name a few).\nFortunately, the reactions the materials undergo in wafer processing can result in a large portion of the GHG’s being eliminated, and point-of-use abatement systems are a standard means to destruct much of the remaining high-GWP emissions (often >95%). Applied includes its own post-process chamber emissions data and assumes IPCC default destruction and removal efficiencies (DRE) [7] for abatement in its Scope 3 calculations (see Fig. 4) to accurately model the GHG emissions.\nWhen appropriate, Applied also includes natural gas burned in point-of-use abatement systems, a utility which is not currently included in the S23 Guidelines (see Fig. 3). The remaining post-abatement emissions convert to mass-equivalent CO2 based on the IPCC AR5 GWP100 values [8] and add to the Scope 3 Category 11 total. This approach provides a complete view of the GHG emissions coming directly from the tool (these emissions also contribute to the Scope 1 emissions of the chipmaker).\nSeveral materials commonly used in semiconductor manufacturing have a zero global warming potential, but still have an impact on the environment and should be considered in efforts to improve sustainability. Vapor deposited metals which are mined, refined, and smelted; helium which is extracted from natural gas mining and liquified under intense pressure; silane; and TEOS are all examples of materials consumed in wafer processing with no GWP, and that therefore do not appear in Applied’s Scope 3 Category 11 emissions, consistent with GHG Protocol guidelines.\nThe 3x30 initiative’s metrics include upstream life-cycle-inventory (LCI) data for the input materials to wafer processing, so they do not go unaccounted for by Applied (GHG Protocol captures these emissions in the Scope 3 Category 1 of the chipmaker, but not the equipment maker). Including upstream LCI in Applied’s 3x30 metrics helps to steer process development toward using less material, lower-impact materials, or both, and supports our customers’ efforts toward their own sustainability goals.\nWhat This Means to the Industry\nClear and complete reporting of GHG emissions ensures accountability and helps meaningfully connect actions to results. Guidelines like the GHG Protocol and S23 provide general-purpose frameworks that all semiconductor companies can use and are vital to tracking progress towards a more sustainable industry. Alternatively, sector-specific frameworks like Applied’s 3x30 can be a better option for companies to drive their own business and sustainability goals. In all cases, transparency is key to giving credibility to any reported result, whether using a general standard or a more bespoke reporting structure.\nTo ensure completeness in its accounting, Applied is taking an all-of-the-above approach, using existing standards where available, transparency whenever possible, and developing its own metrics when needed. Despite the variability inherent to Scope 3 accounting, it remains a powerful tool for understanding one’s own indirect emissions that can have outsized impact on a company’s overall footprint, and thus is key to any meaningful efforts to address climate change. Manufacturers should be incentivized to influence the users of their products to reduce energy use and emissions wherever possible, which is what Scope 3 accounting is all about.\nAs chipmakers move to renewable energy, their Scope 2 emissions and Applied’s Scope 3 Category 11 emissions will drop. While it makes sense to acknowledge the changing energy landscape, Applied is not relying on this trend to achieve its sustainability goals. More widely available renewable energy will not preclude the need for the industry as a whole to use energy responsibly and look for ways to grow while reducing net energy usage. By setting the 3x30 energy reduction goals in kWh rather than CO2eq, Applied directly links its sustainability goals with its customers’ efforts to reduce emissions.\nApplied can make its products more efficient, but ultimately it must collaborate with its customers and industry partners to affect large-scale change and enable the achievement of ambitions like net zero targets. Information sharing (and transparency around metrics) will be key to accurate reporting, and many solutions will require co-development between material suppliers, equipment makers and chipmakers. Through such collaboration and transparency Applied is committed to deliver on its promise to Make Possible® a Better Future.\n[1] https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/report-stark-gap-in-climate-disclosures-exists-between-large--small-public-companies-301465038.html\n[2] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/the-chip-industry-has-a-problem-with-its-giant-carbon-footprint\n[3] Proceedings - International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, 2021-February, 854-867; https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/chasing-carbon-the-elusive-environmental-footprint-of-computing\n[4] https://www.appliedmaterials.com/us/en/blog/blog-posts/adding-sustainability-to-the-definition-of-fab-performance.html\n[5] https://ghgprotocol.org/\n[6] https://store-us.semi.org/products/s02300-semi-s23-guide-for-conservation-of-energy-utilities-and-materials-used-by-semiconductor-manufacturing-equipment\n[7] 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, 6.58, Table 6.17\n[8] https://www.ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/ghgp/Global-Warming-Potential-Values%20%28Feb%2016%202016%29_1.pdf","### human: 
What sustainability framework is Applied Materials using to reduce GHG emissions, and what are its targets and timeline for achieving emissions reduction?

### assistant<|im_sep|>Applied Materials uses a 1x – 100x – 10,000x sustainability framework which characterizes the environmental impact of its operations, the use of its products, and the products it enables. The semiconductor manufacturer launched the 3x30 initiative in 2020, with three targets for Applied’s products to reach by the year 2030: (1) a 30% reduction in equivalent energy use, (2) a 30% reduction in the impact of chemical use and (3) a 30% reduction in required cleanroom floorspace. These goals are incorporated into the company's GHG emissions reports. Additionally, Applied Materials uses the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for accounting for the majority of its GHG emissions, despite the lack of a universal standard in the semiconductor industry.

For many people in underserved communities, certain initiatives are also pathways to homeownership, job creation, and small business development. This may include organizations working with low-income communities to create school to career pathways by helping students develop certain in-demand industry or technology skills. Companies can also positively make an impact through product donations, cash grants, and employee volunteerism.\nThis company spotlight identifies three companies making new strides in societal and community investment. Applied Materials, Ecolab, and Travelers all remain committed to finding unique ways to help those who traditionally have not had access to opportunity.\nApplied Materials\nAll children—regardless of gender, race, or income level—should be able to pursue their dreams. Generation Girl®, an initiative of the Applied Materials Foundation, is working to make sure that all girls[1] can reach their potential.\nBy leveraging three important pillars–philanthropic funding, employee volunteers, and a commitment to organizational capacity–Generation Girl is expanding the opportunity for girls to lead. With a commitment to access in mind, the initiative intentionally prioritizes programs serving Black, Latina, and Native American girls, as well as girls from low-income backgrounds – groups that are currently underrepresented in tech.\nIn the first three years of the initiative, more than 25,000 girls across the country have participated in programs funded by Generation Girl, according to the company’s external evaluation[2]. Although the COVID-19 pandemic caused a variety of barriers to participation last year, girls participating in funded programs reported strong results in key areas, including growth in self-confidence (83%), competence in STEM skills (73%), and interest in pursuing post-secondary education (84%). And while the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted communities of color, close to 70% of girls in funded programs identified as Black, Latinx, or Native American, and 64% of girls came from low-income backgrounds.\nThe second not-so-secret ingredient in the Generation Girl initiative is employee engagement. In 2021, Applied Materials volunteers from across the country invested their time and talent by participating in mock interview workshops, career talks, and hands-on activities to introduce girls to the semiconductor industry and encourage them to dream big.\nThese activities are mutually beneficial, as girls gain access to female role models in tech and employees gain inspiration from this new generation. As one grantee recently shared, “Thank you for such a wonderful, non-threatening introduction to engineering and STEM, and a FUN way to broaden the exposure of these budding leaders!” The response from the Applied employee volunteer? “Working with the girls was so fun, and I loved the energy of the team – it was inspiring!”\nThe third and final component of this work focuses on building the capacity of the girl-serving nonprofit sector. Organizations focused on programs for girls and women are chronically underfunded, with less than 0.1% of 2017 philanthropic giving focused on reaching underrepresented women and girls of color specifically. Through a bimonthly Community of Practice, the Applied Materials Foundation facilitates conversations amongst its over 30 nonprofit grantees. To date, sessions have focused on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on girls, tactics to create trauma-informed programming, and how to engage youth through brave spaces.\nThrough philanthropic funding, employee volunteerism, and nonprofit capacity building, the Applied Materials Foundation is committed to developing the next generation of diverse female leaders.\nLearn more about Generation Girl® here.\n[1] “Girls” refers to gender-expansive youth (cis girls, trans girls, non-binary youth, gender non-conforming youth, gender queer youth and any girl-identified youth).

Metrics and outcomes are provided by grantee organizations with analysis led by an external evaluator, Learning for Action.\nEcolab\nAs we all continue to experience global crises—including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the escalating effects of climate change, and more recently, the war in Ukraine—companies must remain steadfastly committed to supporting communities around the globe.\nFor nearly 100 years, Ecolab has been supporting communities both close to home and around the world. In 2021, Ecolab responded with its largest giving year to date, valued at more than $40 million dollars, working hand-in-hand with non-profit partners to positively make an impact through product donations, cash grants, and employee volunteerism. Highlights include:\nProduct Donations: The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically increased the need for cleaning and sanitizing products. In partnership with relief organizations World Emergency Relief, Good360, and Global Citizen USA, Ecolab donated $32 million of its cleaning, sanitizing, and public health products across 22 countries to help combat COVID-19.\nCash Grants: Through more than $7 million in cash grants, the Ecolab Foundation supported local organizations in the communities where its associates live and work. These organizations are making a difference across youth and education, civic and community development, arts and culture, and the environment and conservation, as well as organizations that provide resources for underserved communities.\nEmployee Engagement: Ecolab associates also were individually driven to do their part. Their dedication of both time and resources embodies Ecolab’s purpose to help make the world a cleaner, safer, and healthier place, including supporting charities in their local communities through more than 3,600 volunteer events across 30 countries. In addition, associates gave more than $3 million in contributions to more than 2,600 nonprofit organizations around the world through Ecolab’s Community Giving Program augmented with a match from the Ecolab Foundation. For example, in partnership with Kids in Need, Ecolab associates in the Washington, D.C., area assembled more than 1,000 backpacks with supplies for local children to start the school year.\nAs the war in Ukraine continues, Ecolab is committed to finding ways to help those in need. As of June 2022, the company has committed more than $8.5 million worth of Ecolab products to support the humanitarian response to the Ukraine conflict. Additionally, employees have contributed their own funds, with the Ecolab Foundation offering a 50% match for all associates wishing to donate to Ukraine relief efforts through Ecolab community giving opportunities.\nFor more information about Ecolab’s community giving initiatives and the Ecolab Foundation, visit the Community Involvement page.\nTravelers\nA successful future starts in the classroom, but many students from economically under-resourced communities struggle to obtain equitable access to academic and professional development opportunities. This gap can in turn hinder a business’s ability to effectively attract and retain diverse talent.\nThat’s why Travelers, a leading property and casualty insurer, focuses so much of its annual giving on organizations and programs that assist students in grades 5 through 12, as well as college students and young adults seeking careers in insurance. In fact, the company’s signature education program, Travelers EDGE® (Empowering Dreams for Graduation and Employment), is designed to increase degree attainment for diverse students while also providing a talent pipeline into the insurance and financial services industry.\nIt was initially Travelers’ board of directors who envisioned a program that would benefit the community and Travelers. After extensive research and conversations with multiple stakeholders, the company found that there was a significant gap in graduation rates between students from economically under-resourced communities and those from more affluent communities. They also discovered that diverse students from under-resourced communities have historically been underrepresented in the insurance and financial services industry. The company resolved to address that disparity, and Travelers EDGE was born.\nFast-forward 15 years, and Travelers EDGE is a sustainable school-to-career model that supports underrepresented students from high school through college and into the workplace in Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, and Minnesota. Through partnerships with higher education institutions, community groups and high schools, Travelers EDGE provides students with a holistic support system that includes financial assistance and access to mentors, internships, job-shadow opportunities, and professional development workshops.\nSince its inception, Travelers EDGE has helped more than 300 students complete bachelor’s degrees, and more than 100 of those graduates have gone on to work at Travelers.\nTravelers understands the importance of providing educational and economic opportunities to its communities. With the help of programs like Travelers EDGE, the company continues to work toward bridging the gap, helping students thrive.\nAbout Company SpotlightsCompany spotlights are created through a thoughtful information sharing and communications support process led by CECP, determining companies through a review of our pillars of excellence: CEO leadership, partnership, innovation, measurement, and integration into the business.

What are the ways in which Applied Materials, Ecolab, and Travelers are contributing to societal and community investments?
### assistant:;
On August 8, 2022, ThreeBLMedia reported on the societal and community investment initiatives of three companies - Applied Materials, Ecolab, and Travelers. 

Applied Materials, through its initiative Generation Girl®, uses philanthropic funding, employee volunteering, and commitment to increase organizational capacity to help girls reach their potential, with a specific focus on Black, Latina, and Native American girls, as well as girls from low-income backgrounds.

Ecolab is dedicated to aiding global crises and has had its largest giving year in 2021, with more than $40 million worth of product donations, cash grants, and employee volunteering. These efforts ranged from supplying cleaning and sanitizing products to fight against COVID-19 to supporting local organizations through the Ecolab Foundation and hosting volunteer events around the world.

Travelers have implemented their signature education program, Travelers EDGE® (Empowering Dreams for Graduation and Employment), to increase degree attainment for diverse students and provide a talent pipeline into the insurance and financial services industry. This program assists underrepresented students from high school through college into the workplace by offering financial assistance and access to mentors, internships, and professional development workshops."

It highlights the significant progress we’ve made in reducing our carbon footprint and transitioning to renewable energy. At the same time, the report underscores the sustainability challenges we continue to face as a company and as an industry.\nThe good news: Through increased use of renewable electricity, Applied achieved a 28-percent reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions footprint—the emissions produced directly by Applied and by the electricity we purchase—even as our overall energy consumption rose by approximately 7 percent to support new facilities and expanded production. Key initiatives enabling the emissions reduction include previous investments in on-site solar power generation at our facilities in Singapore, Texas, India and China, as well as a virtual power purchase agreement with White Mesa Wind, LLC in White Mesa, Texas.\nToday, renewable power accounts for approximately 80 percent and 57 percent, respectively, of our U.S. and global energy consumption. Continued progress is essential, both to accommodate the growth in demand for our products we anticipate over the next decade and beyond, as well as to reach our commitment to achieve 100-percent renewable energy use in the U.S. by 2022, and globally by 2030.\nIn terms of Scope 3 emissions—those generated across our entire value chain—Applied has focused on establishing benchmarks and priorities that can inform future action. Early in 2022, we assessed the 15 categories defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to identify and inventory the primary sources of our Scope 3 emissions for our semiconductor products.\nUsing 2019 as a baseline, we found that Use of Sold Products (Category 11) represents the lion’s share—nearly 80 percent—of our Scope 3 emissions. This category comprises the combined total lifetime emissions from all Applied semiconductor equipment sold during a reporting year. The metric includes emissions from energy consumption in customer fabs, as well as chemicals and gases used in operational processes. Purchased Goods and Services (Category 1) represents about 15 percent of Applied’s estimated supply chain emissions and is the second largest contributor to our Scope 3 footprint for our semiconductor equipment.\nReducing Scope 3 Emissions Requires Collective Action\nReducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions is a relatively straightforward task; we can refine our consumption and sourcing practices to improve the energy sustainability of our operations. Moreover, we can directly measure the impact of those initiatives against the aggressive targets we’ve set.\nReducing Scope 3 emissions represents a much more challenging proposition. Myriad complexities are involved in gauging emission causes, effects and impacts over the long term. Corrective actions require coordination and collaboration across the industry ecosystem. Towards this end, we’re working with other industry leaders to align on standards for measuring semiconductor product emissions, as well as to collectively implement initiatives to drive down emissions in line with science-based targets. To be effective, these efforts will require shared responsibility and—more importantly—specific organizational commitments to ensure accountability.\nThe Semiconductor Conundrum\nSemiconductors play a critical role in enabling digital transformation. For one thing, they underlie technology innovations such as cloud computing, intelligent automation and robotics—innovations that allow businesses to streamline their operations and create new ways of engaging with customers. Renewable energy and smart grids rely on semiconductors, as do collaboration and remote monitoring tools that dramatically reduce the need for travel.\nIn other words, business and sustainability agendas will continue to drive demand for semiconductors. As the world uses more chips, it is crucial for the semiconductor industry to continue developing cleaner and more sustainable operational models, otherwise we ultimately risk becoming part of the problem rather than the solution.\nIn his keynote speech at SEMICON West 2020, Applied’s CEO Gary Dickerson illustrated these risks and put forth a call to action for the industry. Simply put, it is imperative to enable a smart, digital future while simultaneously reducing our environmental impact. Toward this goal, Applied created an environmental, social and governance (ESG) framework bringing together thought leaders across our business and industry.\nLong-Term Vision, Near-Term Actions\nTo address the sustainability challenge, we need to work individually as organizations and collectively as an industry to define goals and agree on actions. To tackle this transformational task, it’s instructive to consider lessons learned from businesses pursuing any type of strategic initiative that involves dramatic change and fundamentally new ways of doing things.\nExperience has shown that businesses pursuing transformation often make the mistake of setting overly ambitious goals without developing a clear-cut plan on how to achieve them. Conversely, many dive in with a hodgepodge of discrete, tactical initiatives that yield limited benefits.\nSuccessful initiatives combine a long-term strategic vision together with near-term actions that deliver measurable results. Put differently, high-level discussions around the potential future state are tied to a detailed roadmap that defines specific actions and how they contribute to the ultimate goal.\nA similar mindset can help us continue our progress towards building a sustainable company (as measured by reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) and enabling a sustainable industry by contributing to the development and execution of ecosystem-wide Scope 3 reduction strategies. Applied’s commitment to supporting this comprehensive approach will include refining our data, analytical models and assumptions around Scope 3 emissions, as well as establishing science-based targets to ensure that our goals align with continually evolving findings. At the same time, we will focus on achieving specific targets, such as keeping emissions in line with the 1.5°C pathway that has been agreed to as an international standard.

638ff02e3e5c1cbbb0d02ef0,TheNewYorkTimes,Strategy,"As Battles Rage, Ukraine Rejects Macron Plea Not to ‘Humiliate’ Russia",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/04/world/europe/ukraine-macron-russia-izium.html?searchResultPosition=591,2022-06-04,Andrew E. Kramer and Jason Horowitz,"KRAMATORSK, Ukraine — As Ukrainian troops tried to claw back territory and stave off a blistering Russian assault along the country’s embattled eastern front, the government on Saturday sought also to repel a demand earlier in the day by President Emmanuel Macron of France that Moscow not be humiliated to improve chances of reaching a diplomatic solution.“We must not humiliate Russia so that the day when the fighting stops we can build an exit ramp through diplomatic means,” Mr. Macron, who has sought to position himself as the world’s chief negotiator with the Kremlin, said in an interview with French newspapers. “I am convinced that it is France’s role to be a mediating power.”Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, responded with a scathing post on social media.“Calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it,” Mr. Kuleba wrote. Instead, he argued, peace and the saving of lives could best be achieved by Russia being “put in its place.”The exchange comes as the war has settled into what seems increasingly destined to be a slog.The Ukrainians and Russians both claimed Saturday to be inflicting decisive losses against one another in the battle for Sievierodonetsk, the last major city in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine still under Ukrainian control.But the fighting was not limited to that town. A senior Ukrainian official claimed on Saturday that the country’s troops had reached a milestone in grinding down the Russian invasion force in eastern Ukraine. Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to President Volodymyr Zelensky, posted on the social networking site Telegram that most of a large Russian military unit had been destroyed in heavy fighting over the past weeks.“Almost the entire 35th All-Russian Army was destroyed,” he wrote.Mr. Yermak’s claim was supported by commentary from a Russian military blogger cited in a report by the influential Institute for the Study of War. Incompetent Russian commanders had failed to prepare troops for combat in a forested area near the city of Izium, the report said.The claim of the routing of the Russian unit could not be independently verified.Ukrainian soldiers interviewed over the past week have described fierce fighting in the forests around Izium, a strategic city that Russia is using as a base for attacks south toward the cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. Ukrainian forces are also taking heavy losses, 60 to 100 fatalities a day, Mr. Zelensky said recently.The British Defense Ministry said Saturday that Russia’s recent use of airstrikes and artillery fire has been a factor in its limited success in Ukraine’s east, a contrast with its largely ineffective air attacks earlier in the war. The Russian reliance on  long-range strikes has probably depleted the country’s stock of precision-guided missiles, leading to more use of unguided munitions that can cause substantial civilian casualties, the ministry said.Also on Saturday, an air-launched cruise missile hit the Odesa region on Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, Odesa city officials said on Telegram. The missile struck a mostly agricultural area with warehouses, injuring two people, according to the officials.And Russian and Ukrainian officials traded blame for the burning of the main temple of the All Saints hermitage, a 16th-century monastery in eastern Ukraine that is considered one of the three most sacred sites in Ukraine for Orthodox believers.The increasing terror from the sky came a day after Ukraine, on occasion of the 100th day of the war, took stock of its successes in holding back and in key places repelling the invasion by Russia, which had sought to quickly conquer the capital, Kyiv, and topple the government. Mr. Zelensky insisted “victory will be ours” and announced that 50 foreign embassies had resumed activities in the capital.But on the 101st day, Ukraine faced anew the harsh realities on the ground, and increasingly from overhead.Russia’s airstrikes provided cover to their troops engaged in the bitter fighting in the contested city of Sievierodonetsk.And Russian troops continued to target the last remaining bridge into Sievierodonetsk to keep Ukraine from moving in reinforcements, food and medicine into a city that has become the main theater of war and the focus of Russia’s war machine. Despite its early and devastating setbacks, Russia has come to occupy a fifth of the country.The intensity of the Russian attack and frequency of Russian reinforcements to Sievierodonetsk led to predictions that the city would soon fall. But Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk province, who recently had a dour prognosis for the city’s survival, told Ukraine’s national television that Ukrainian troops had retaken 20 percent of the territory they had lost, adding that it was “not realistic” the city would fall in the next two weeks.As Ukrainian forces try to take back territory in the East, its State Emergency Services of Ukraine has removed 127,393 explosive devices, with the efforts focused mostly on urban areas in the Kyiv,  Sumy and Zhytomyr regions that were occupied by Russia early in the war, according to a report by the United Nations Development Program.Russia’s retreat from those areas has made them more accessible for clear-up operations, the report said, adding that Ukrainians had covered an area of more than 28,714 square kilometers (more than 11,000 square miles) but that it could take years to clear all of the mines in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have also launched a counteroffensive near the occupied city of Kherson in the country’s south.But a punishing, costly and tragic military stalemate is increasingly foreseen by experts. Ukraine has been outgunned, but will soon receive long-range M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, commonly known as HIMARS, from the United States. The exchanges of evermore lethal firepower will likely add to the many millions of people who have already been displaced, a death toll of at least 4,000 civilians and a Ukrainian economy already in tatters with roughly $100 billion in losses.The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on Friday that Russia would continue what it calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine until “all goals have been attained.”But one thing Russia had already achieved was international isolation and a solidifying of the Western alliance against it. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general, met Friday with Prime Minister Sanna Marin of Finland in Washington about the country’s application to the military alliance. He has advised allies to be prepared for “the long haul” and warned this week that the conflict had become a “war of attrition.”On Saturday, an American warship, the U.S.S. Kearsarge, was moored in Stockholm, Sweden, with 26 warplanes and 2,400 Marines and sailors aboard, a symbol of the protection that  NATO membership would offer Sweden and Finland, both of which are seeking to join.  As the battle lines become more entrenched between Russia and the West, experts predict Russian cyberattacks, global disinformation campaigns and a potential food crisis prompted by a Russian naval blockade.

Instead, he argued, peace and the saving of lives could best be achieved by Russia being “put in its place.”The exchange comes as the war has settled into what seems increasingly destined to be a slog.The Ukrainians and Russians both claimed Saturday to be inflicting decisive losses against one another in the battle for Sievierodonetsk, the last major city in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine still under Ukrainian control.But the fighting was not limited to that town. A senior Ukrainian official claimed on Saturday that the country’s troops had reached a milestone in grinding down the Russian invasion force in eastern Ukraine. Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to President Volodymyr Zelensky, posted on the social networking site Telegram that most of a large Russian military unit had been destroyed in heavy fighting over the past weeks.“Almost the entire 35th All-Russian Army was destroyed,” he wrote.Mr. Yermak’s claim was supported by commentary from a Russian military blogger cited in a report by the influential Institute for the Study of War. Incompetent Russian commanders had failed to prepare troops for combat in a forested area near the city of Izium, the report said.The claim of the routing of the Russian unit could not be independently verified.Ukrainian soldiers interviewed over the past week have described fierce fighting in the forests around Izium, a strategic city that Russia is using as a base for attacks south toward the cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. Ukrainian forces are also taking heavy losses, 60 to 100 fatalities a day, Mr. Zelensky said recently.The British Defense Ministry said Saturday that Russia’s recent use of airstrikes and artillery fire has been a factor in its limited success in Ukraine’s east, a contrast with its largely ineffective air attacks earlier in the war. The Russian reliance on  long-range strikes has probably depleted the country’s stock of precision-guided missiles, leading to more use of unguided munitions that can cause substantial civilian casualties, the ministry said.Also on Saturday, an air-launched cruise missile hit the Odesa region on Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, Odesa city officials said on Telegram. The missile struck a mostly agricultural area with warehouses, injuring two people, according to the officials.And Russian and Ukrainian officials traded blame for the burning of the main temple of the All Saints hermitage, a 16th-century monastery in eastern Ukraine that is considered one of the three most sacred sites in Ukraine for Orthodox believers.The increasing terror from the sky came a day after Ukraine, on occasion of the 100th day of the war, took stock of its successes in holding back and in key places repelling the invasion by Russia, which had sought to quickly conquer the capital, Kyiv, and topple the government. Mr. Zelensky insisted “victory will be ours” and announced that 50 foreign embassies had resumed activities in the capital.But on the 101st day, Ukraine faced anew the harsh realities on the ground, and increasingly from overhead.Russia’s airstrikes provided cover to their troops engaged in the bitter fighting in the contested city of Sievierodonetsk.And Russian troops continued to target the last remaining bridge into Sievierodonetsk to keep Ukraine from moving in reinforcements, food and medicine into a city that has become the main theater of war and the focus of Russia’s war machine. Despite its early and devastating setbacks, Russia has come to occupy a fifth of the country.The intensity of the Russian attack and frequency of Russian reinforcements to Sievierodonetsk led to predictions that the city would soon fall. But Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk province, who recently had a dour prognosis for the city’s survival, told Ukraine’s national television that Ukrainian troops had retaken 20 percent of the territory they had lost, adding that it was “not realistic” the city would fall in the next two weeks.As Ukrainian forces try to take back territory in the East, its State Emergency Services of Ukraine has removed 127,393 explosive devices, with the efforts focused mostly on urban areas in the Kyiv,  Sumy and Zhytomyr regions that were occupied by Russia early in the war, according to a report by the United Nations Development Program.Russia’s retreat from those areas has made them more accessible for clear-up operations, the report said, adding that Ukrainians had covered an area of more than 28,714 square kilometers (more than 11,000 square miles) but that it could take years to clear all of the mines in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have also launched a counteroffensive near the occupied city of Kherson in the country’s south.But a punishing, costly and tragic military stalemate is increasingly foreseen by experts. Ukraine has been outgunned, but will soon receive long-range M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, commonly known as HIMARS, from the United States. The exchanges of evermore lethal firepower will likely add to the many millions of people who have already been displaced, a death toll of at least 4,000 civilians and a Ukrainian economy already in tatters with roughly $100 billion in losses.The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on Friday that Russia would continue what it calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine until “all goals have been attained.”But one thing Russia had already achieved was international isolation and a solidifying of the Western alliance against it. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general, met Friday with Prime Minister Sanna Marin of Finland in Washington about the country’s application to the military alliance. He has advised allies to be prepared for “the long haul” and warned this week that the conflict had become a “war of attrition.”On Saturday, an American warship, the U.S.S. Kearsarge, was moored in Stockholm, Sweden, with 26 warplanes and 2,400 Marines and sailors aboard, a symbol of the protection that  NATO membership would offer Sweden and Finland, both of which are seeking to join.  As the battle lines become more entrenched between Russia and the West, experts predict Russian cyberattacks, global disinformation campaigns and a potential food crisis prompted by a Russian naval blockade. Ukraine is one of the world’s leading exporters of grain and cooking oil, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has been accused by Western leaders of trying to leverage its control of those supplies to gain relief from sanctions.And those sanctions continued to be felt.

### assistant: 
According to reports from The New York Times on 2022-06-04, the war appears to be turning into a prolonged engagement, with intense ongoing fights for control of key cities such as Sievierodonetsk in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Also, Ukrainian forces seem to be having some success in repelling the Russian invasion in the east, with Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to President Volodymyr Zelensky, claiming that a large Russian military unit was mostly destroyed. Still, Ukrainian forces are also taking heavy losses, with estimates of 60 to 100 fatalities a day. There are fears this conflict will escalate into a stalemate, wreaking further damage to civilian lives, the economy, and leading to an increase in displaced people, since Ukraine will soon receive more weapons from the United States.

The war has caused significant damage to Ukraine's land and economy. The State Emergency Services of Ukraine reported that they had removed 127,393 explosive devices, primarily from areas in the Kyiv, Sumy, and Zhytomyr regions that were occupied by Russia. The report from the United Nations Development Program stated that clearing all the mines in Ukraine could take years to complete. As far as the economy is concerned, the war has resulted in losses estimated at around $100 billion. Despite these damages, Ukraine has managed to hold back the Russian invasion in key areas (The New York Times, 2022-06-04).

As reported by The New York Times on 2022-06-04, Russia's actions in Ukraine have led to international isolation and solidification of the Western alliance against Russia. Punitive sanctions have caused significant impact on Russia's economy, with Marriott being the latest multinational to suspend operations in the country. NATO's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned allies to be prepared for “the long haul” and suggested that the conflict had become a “war of attrition”. He also met with Prime Minister Sanna Marin of Finland in Washington about Finland’s application to join NATO. Additionally, the U.S.S.

Ukraine’s soldiers are under relentless fire.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/01/world/europe/ukraine-russia-losses-east.html?searchResultPosition=716,2022-06-01,Andrew E. Kramer,"KRAMATORSK, Ukraine — It all starts with a whistle, said Vladislav Goncharenko, a Ukrainian army sergeant, describing the relentless Russian shelling.“You lie in a trench,” he said, waiting in an ambulance packed with other wounded soldiers. “There are very loud explosions. You want to get deeper into the ground. And you have shrapnel whistling above you, like flies.”Soldiers, he said, “just want it to stop.”Though much of the world’s focus in the war has been on Russia’s disorganized and flawed campaign, Ukraine, too, is struggling. Ukraine’s army has suffered heavy losses, shown signs of disarray and, step by step, fallen back from some long-held areas in Donbas, the eastern region that is now the war’s epicenter.The momentum Ukraine generated after pushing Russian forces back from Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv, the second-largest city, has given way in the east to weeks of give-and-take over villages, heavy shelling — and a stream of Ukrainian dead and wounded from the battlefields.Ukraine’s troops now face a Russian force that has shifted strategy from the hasty, reckless advances of the early weeks of the war to a creeping, grinding march enabled by massive artillery bombardments.On Wednesday, Russian forces advanced in street fighting in the ruins of the city of Sievierodonetsk, a key target of their offensive. A local official said on Wednesday that Russian forces controlled about 70 percent of the city, where only about 12,000 residents remain out of a prewar population of 100,000 after weeks of intense shelling.Ukrainian soldiers there are at risk of being surrounded. With bridges over the Seversky Donets River destroyed or under fire, resupply has become tenuous.Ukrainian officials have been candid about the army’s travails while arguing more rapid deliveries of Western weaponry will resolve them. Every day in the current heavy fighting, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Newsmax this week, 60 to 100 Ukrainian soldiers are killed and another about 500 soldiers are wounded in combat.In his nightly address, Mr. Zelensky acknowledged the battle for control of the Donbas region was “very difficult” but emphasized that his troops were having success in the south, near Kherson and around Zaporizhzhia, and around Kharkiv in the northeast.“The frontline situation must be assessed comprehensively,” he said. “Not by one area, where there is the most tough situation and which attracts the most attention, but by the whole frontline.”To fill gaps in the frontline, Ukraine has resorted to deploying minimally trained volunteers of the Territorial Defense Force, which mobilized quickly as the war started. Hints of morale lapses have surfaced. One unit recorded a video protesting dire conditions. In interviews, soldiers said their artillery guns sometimes go quiet for lack of ammunition.“Those people who said that the war would end very soon, that we have already won, that we will celebrate in April, said a dangerous thing,” Ukraine’s national security adviser, Oleksiy Danilov, told Ukrainian media this week.In the messy seesaw fighting on the East’s rolling plains, Ukrainian forces are buoyed by the promise of Western weapons arriving soon.On Tuesday, President Biden announced plans to give Ukraine multiple rocket launch systems, a powerful, long-range artillery weapon. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have said the systems are not intended to strike targets within Russia.On Wednesday, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany promised to send a sophisticated air defense system and a tracking radar capable of locating Russian artillery. Mr. Scholz had faced criticism from Ukraine and some German lawmakers that he had not done enough to support Ukraine’s military. He did not announce a timeline for the new shipments.With the arrival of new weapons systems weeks away at best, it’s unclear if they will land in Ukraine in time to repel the Russians’ slow advance. Last week, Ukraine was forced from positions it had defended through eight years of war with Russian-backed separatists near the town of Svitlodarsk.Throughout the war, the state of the Ukrainian military has been difficult to assess from publicly available sources. As the war began, the Ukrainian military had about 30,000 troops deployed in the Donbas region, but neither the government nor the military will provide a current figure.The Ukrainian government has largely withheld casualty figures and Western governments have not volunteered their own assessments of the army’s difficulties, as they have in describing Russian setbacks. The last Ukrainian casualty update came on April 16, when Mr. Zelensky said fewer than 3,000 soldiers had died, but his comments about casualties last week suggest the figure is far higher now.Ukraine is also hampered by the deterioration and depletion of its Soviet-legacy artillery, said Mykhailo Zhirokhov, the author of a book on Ukrainian artillery. The worn barrels fire less accurately. Shells are running low. Western replacements are arriving, but slowly.The morale of volunteer fighters is also proving to be a challenge, at least in some units. Many who signed up to Ukraine’s Territorial Defense Force in the first days of war believed their task would be limited to defending their hometowns. There were teachers, computer programmers, taxi drivers and others, most with no battlefield experience.Now they find themselves deployed into vicious combat in the East, an indication of Ukraine’s mounting demand for frontline fighters.A law passed on May 3, after many volunteers had already enlisted, allowed their deployment to combat outside their home regions.Some are trained only after arriving at the front to fire heavy machine guns, anti-tank missiles and grenade launchers, because the weapons are only available there, Serhiy Sabko, the head of the Territorial Defense Force general staff, told Ukrainian media last month. “We are forced to carry out additional training” near the front, he said.Meanwhile, the strain on military families is showing.In Lviv, a city in the West that has avoided serious shelling, wives and mothers of men in the 103rd Territorial Defense Brigade have protested, terrified about their husbands’ and sons’ deployment into combat in the East. To assuage concerns, a commander, Vitaliy Kupriy, met with about 200 women in a concert hall but the conversation devolved into screaming and crying, local media reported.In interviews in ambulances as they were evacuated from the front, about a dozen wounded Ukrainian soldiers said artillery was the cause of most casualties. They echoed appeals of Ukrainian officials for the West to transfer more long-range artillery to counter Russian bombardment.“It’s a weapon that I, as a rifleman, cannot fight,” Sergeant Goncharenko said of Russian artillery.He was wounded in a barrage on the northern rim of the front around Sievierodonetsk that knocked a tree over the trench he was sheltering in. He suffered a concussion that left him dizzy, vomiting and unable to fight.The Russians mix artillery barrages with probing maneuvers by infantry or armored vehicles, identifying new targets by approaching Ukrainian lines and drawing fire. The maneuver is called “reconnaissance until contact.”Ukrainians open fire on the probing Russians, causing casualties. “We collect their dead,” Sergeant Goncharenko said.But then, having ascertained Ukrainian positions, he said, the Russians “pull back and fire artillery.”Russia has paid heavy costs as well. On Tuesday American officials estimated that the Russian military’s overall fighting strength had been diminished by about 20 percent.  In late March, NATO estimated that 7,000 to 15,000 Russian troops had been killed.Still, Russia’s artillery has devastated towns and cities ahead of the advance and prompted about 80 percent of the population of Ukrainian-controlled areas in the Donbas to flee. Russian soldiers wind up taking ruins.“The only way they will occupy Donbas is reducing it to rubble,” said Maria Zolkina, a political analyst. “If they capture Donbas, it will be without cities” or people.Some military analysts see no clear end for now, and Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, on Wednesday predicted “many months of conflict” ahead. Russia is unlikely to soon capture the claimed borders of two separatist states whose independence it recognized in February. And Ukraine seems far from ready for a counterattack to turn the tide.“This is a war where territory is going to change hands, there’s no logical stopping point in the conflict and there’s no stalemate,” Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va., said in a telephone interview. “This is going to be a longer war.”Sergeant Bohdan Yermak, whose lungs were damaged by the blast wave when a tank shell exploded nearby, said Ukrainian commanders sometimes call for strikes but artillery batteries cannot fulfill the orders for lack of ammunition. “They say they are saving ammunition for a rainy day,” he said.Long-range weapons and ammunition and related military aid packages from the United States and European allies will help, he said, based on his experience at the front.For now, said Sergeant Mykola Pokotila, who was wounded in a battle north of the town of Sloviansk, Ukrainian soldiers in the East are beleaguered, enduring punishing artillery barrages. “I’ve never seen such hell.”Maria Varenikova and Michael Levenson contributed reporting.","TheNewYorkTimes: 2022-06-01 KRAMATORSK, Ukraine — It all starts with a whistle, said Vladislav Goncharenko, a Ukrainian army sergeant, describing the relentless Russian shelling.“You lie in a trench,” he said, waiting in an ambulance packed with other wounded soldiers. “There are very loud explosions.

It’s a grim routine for medical personnel often working around the clock. And not all limbs can be saved.KRAMATORSK, Ukraine — Days after Russian forces invaded, Yaroslav Bohak, a young cardiovascular surgeon, was at home with his family in the relative safety of western Ukraine, when a colleague placed a desperate call from the east, pleading with him to come help.Many doctors had fled the fighting, his friend said, and conditions at the hospital resembled a bygone era of warfare, with the surgeons who remained amputating limbs, instead of trying to repair them, to save grievously wounded soldiers.“He called me and said he could no longer cut off the arms of young people,” Dr. Bohak said, as he stood in an operating room of a hospital in Kramatorsk. “When I came here, I had surgery on the first day.”As Russian forces pummel eastern Ukraine with a mix of artillery, airstrikes and rocket attacks, frontline hospitals, many of them in poorer, rural areas, have become overwhelmed. They are severely short-staffed or have been abandoned completely, as doctors and nurses have fled the violence.All day long, the walls of the hospital shake with the thunder of battles raging near Kramatorsk, an industrial city in the Donbas region, where Russian forces have been waging a bloody offensive. A steady stream of ambulances arrives at the sandbag-reinforced emergency room, ferrying soldiers and civilians, many with life-threatening wounds.But the hospital is staffed by a skeleton crew. Only two of its 10 doctors remain, aided by six nurses working 24 hour shifts with only one day off for rest, said Tatyana Bakaeva, the senior nurse. (Hospital officials asked that its name not be published for security reasons.)“Only the most stoic remain,” Ms. Bakaeva said. “People are scared, what can you do?”It is a similar story throughout the Donbas: As the toll of wounded mounts, the need for more doctors and nurses becomes even more acute.In Avdiivka, right on the front lines, the lone remaining surgeon and the hospital medical director described spending months in the emergency room, never leaving except for quick dashes to the grocery store amid shelling. In Sloviansk, a city just to the north of Kramatorsk where plumes of smoke from battle can be seen on the horizon, only about a third of the hospital staff remains.The city of Bakhmut sits at a crossroads between Russian forces pushing from the east and the north. There, ambulances jam a small courtyard of the military hospital and the emergency room is almost always full.“Nobody ever prepares for war, and this region is not so densely populated to be able to deal with this many wounded,” said Svitlana Druzenko, who coordinates emergency evacuations of wounded soldiers and civilians from the battle zones. “The wounds are the same for civilians and soldiers because rockets do not choose where to fall.”Many of the wounded from the East are brought to Dnipro, a city of one million that has six big hospitals. But it is four hours’ drive from many frontline positions. And the hospitals there have also been depleted of nursing staff, said Dr. Pavlo Badiul, a surgeon at the Burn and Plastic Surgery Center in Dnipro.The center was full to capacity with war wounded and staff were working continuously without a break, he said.A member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, after training in California, Dr. Badiul put out an appeal through the society’s newsletter for equipment and medical supplies. “Although we get some targeted aid, much is still lost, diverted or taken to the wrong place,’’ he said.Volunteers have pitched in to pick up some of the slack. Ms. Druzenko works for a volunteer emergency medical organization known by its Ukrainian initials PDMSh. Its ambulances and personnel are ubiquitous at hospitals and at so-called yellow zone transfer points, locations on the edge of the battlefield where wounded soldiers are picked up by ambulances and rushed to the nearest hospital.It is dangerous work. Last week, a yellow zone base that Ms. Druzenko’s organization established north of Bakhmut was bombed by Russian forces.“Not only drones, but aviation is working in that area,” Ms. Druzenko said.Most of the surgeons operating out of the hospital in Kramatorsk, including Dr. Bohak, are volunteers. Since he arrived, the hospital has had almost no amputations.Dr. Bohak showed off cellphone videos of his surgeries last week. Digging into singed and shredded flesh, he extracted severed arteries and painstakingly stitched them back together, restoring circulation to the damaged limbs, allowing them and the soldiers they are attached to be saved.“The nearest serious clinic is in Dnipro, which is 280 kilometers from here,” he said. “It takes time to get there, and it may be too late to save the limb. That’s why my arrival was very important.”Not all the limbs can be saved though. Eduard Antanovskyy, the deputy commander of the military unit at the hospital, said that recently a Russian soldier was brought in with a serious leg wound. While at the hospital, he said, the soldier was provided with security guards for protection.“We had to take the leg because the tourniquet was on for too long,” he said. “Even if we wanted to, we couldn’t have saved his leg. We treated him humanely, not the way he deserved to be treated.”Despite months of warnings from the White House and others that Russia was planning to invade, many in Ukraine, including much of the political establishment and even some in the military, refused to believe it. When Russian rockets began to hit Ukrainian cities on Feb. 24, it set off a scramble. Hospitals in particular, were unprepared to handle the sudden surge in patients suffering from the vicious and difficult wounds that war inflicts.In the first week, Dr. Maksim Kozhemyaka, a civilian trauma surgeon, volunteered to assist at the military hospital in Zaporizhzhia, one of the main hubs treating soldiers in eastern and southern Ukraine. Almost immediately, he said, the hospital was inundated with 30 to 40 patients a day and did not have sufficient supplies to handle gunshot wounds or other grievous injuries.“We didn’t believe that this could happen because we understood that in any case there would be huge losses on their side as well,” Dr. Kozhemyaka said in an interview in the hospital’s emergency room. “And of course, we thought that no rational leader of a country would do this.”For the hospital workers persisting through the grim routine, the losses can feel personal, and are sometimes deeply so.One recent morning, ambulances raced up to the small hospital in Sloviansk carrying soldiers wounded in an airstrike just a few miles up the road. One of them carried the battered body of Ihor Ihoryuk, 33, the only child of the hospital’s head nurse. Much of the hospital staff had known him since he was a boy.The force of the explosion, outside a room in a seed factory where he and his comrades were sleeping, had ripped off his arm and his blood spilled onto the asphalt in front of the hospital as he was raced inside.A few hours later, a nurse named Anna emerged from the hospital, her green eye liner running down her face. Ihor could not be saved, she said.“He grew up in front of our eyes,” she said, fighting back the tears.She was holding a box containing Ihor’s black army boots. “He won’t be needing them anymore,” she said.She took them to a spot a short distance from the hospital entrance and set them next to a pair of black tennis shoes that were soaked with blood. They belonged to a soldier who was killed the day before.Carlotta Gall contributed reporting from Dnipro, Ukraine.—","TheNewYorkTimes: 2022-05-18 Operating with skeleton crews, doctors and nurses race to save limbs, and lives. It’s a grim routine for medical personnel often working around the clock. And not all limbs can be saved.KRAMATORSK, Ukraine — Days after Russian forces invaded, Yaroslav Bohak, a young cardiovascular surgeon, was at home with his family in the relative safety of western Ukraine, when a colleague placed a desperate call from the east, pleading with him to come help.Many doctors had fled the fighting, his friend said, and conditions at the hospital resembled a bygone era of warfare, with the surgeons who remained amputating limbs, instead of trying to repair them, to save grievously wounded soldiers.“He called me and said he could no longer cut off the arms of young people,” Dr. Bohak said, as he stood in an operating room of a hospital in Kramatorsk. “When I came here, I had surgery on the first day.”As Russian forces pummel eastern Ukraine with a mix of artillery, airstrikes and rocket attacks, frontline hospitals, many of them in poorer, rural areas, have become overwhelmed. They are severely short-staffed or have been abandoned completely, as doctors and nurses have fled the violence.All day long, the walls of the hospital shake with the thunder of battles raging near Kramatorsk, an industrial city in the Donbas region, where Russian forces have been waging a bloody offensive. A steady stream of ambulances arrives at the sandbag-reinforced emergency room, ferrying soldiers and civilians, many with life-threatening wounds.But the hospital is staffed by a skeleton crew. Only two of its 10 doctors remain, aided by six nurses working 24 hour shifts with only one day off for rest, said Tatyana Bakaeva, the senior nurse. (Hospital officials asked that its name not be published for security reasons.)“Only the most stoic remain,” Ms. Bakaeva said. “People are scared, what can you do?”It is a similar story throughout the Donbas: As the toll of wounded mounts, the need for more doctors and nurses becomes even more acute.In Avdiivka, right on the front lines, the lone remaining surgeon and the hospital medical director described spending months in the emergency room, never leaving except for quick dashes to the grocery store amid shelling. In Sloviansk, a city just to the north of Kramatorsk where plumes of smoke from battle can be seen on the horizon, only about a third of the hospital staff remains.The city of Bakhmut sits at a crossroads between Russian forces pushing from the east and the north. There, ambulances jam a small courtyard of the military hospital and the emergency room is almost always full.“Nobody ever prepares for war, and this region is not so densely populated to be able to deal with this many wounded,” said Svitlana Druzenko, who coordinates emergency evacuations of wounded soldiers and civilians from the battle zones. “The wounds are the same for civilians and soldiers because rockets do not choose where to fall.”Many of the wounded from the East are brought to Dnipro, a city of one million that has six big hospitals. But it is four hours’ drive from many frontline positions. And the hospitals there have also been depleted of nursing staff, said Dr. Pavlo Badiul, a surgeon at the Burn and Plastic Surgery Center in Dnipro.The center was full to capacity with war wounded and staff were working continuously without a break, he said.A member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, after training in California, Dr. Badiul put out an appeal through the society’s newsletter for equipment and medical supplies. “Although we get some targeted aid, much is still lost, diverted or taken to the wrong place,’’ he said.Volunteers have pitched in to pick up some of the slack.

What are the conditions of Ukraine's hospitals amidst Russian forces attacking the eastern region, and how are they impacted by the current situation?

### assistant:;
Ukrainian hospitals, particularly in the eastern region, are reeling under immense pressure due to the onslaught from Russian forces, since their invasion on Feb. 24, as reported by The New York Times on May 18, 2022. Several frontline hospitals, most of which are located in poorer, rural regions, are struggling to manage overwhelming demands. Medical facilities are either severely understaffed or entirely abandoned, as many doctors and nurses have fled the conflict-ridden zones. Hospital staff that remain are dealing with grave conditions, often working round-the-clock and conducting medical procedures such as amputations on gravely wounded soldiers rather than attempting to repair limbs due to a lack of resources. Moreover, many hospitals are operating with minimal staff, with only a fraction of their original doctors and nurses, and are dealing with a constant flood of incoming injured soldiers and civilians. The article includes the story of Yaroslav Bohak, a young cardiovascular surgeon, who was summoned from the relative safety of western Ukraine to help at the overwhelmed hospitals in the east. The article also highlighted the severe shortage of medical supplies and the high demand for more medical personnel across the region, from Kramatorsk to Avdiivka to Sloviansk. Hospitals are so unprepared and overwhelmed that many of the injured must be taken to Dnipro, a city that's four hours’ drive away, but unfortunately, even those hospitals are also short on staff."

63110bcbbcc3a2533b7a0d9c,TheNewYorkTimes,Board,"A Stricken Ukrainian City Empties, and Those Left Fear What’s Next",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/world/asia/ukrainian-kramatorsk.html?searchResultPosition=732,2022-04-10,,"After the deadly strike on the train station in Kramatorsk, Ukraine, those who stayed behind are grim about the future: “We think we will be swept off the face of the earth.”By Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Natalia YermakPhotographs by Tyler HicksKRAMATORSK, Ukraine — Two days after more than 50 people were killed on its platforms by a missile strike, the only sounds at the Kramatorsk railway station on Sunday morning were a distant air-raid siren and the rhythmic sweeping of broken glass.“The town is dead now,” said Tetiana, 50, a shopkeeper who was working next to the station when it was attacked as thousands of people tried to board trains to evacuate the eastern city, fearing it would soon be besieged by Russian forces.Friday’s strike was a gruesome turn for the city after nearly eight years of being near the front line of the country’s struggle against Russia-backed separatists in the region known as Donbas.The station’s main hall was still filled with streaks of blood and luggage on Sunday morning, with the burned-out hulks of two sedans lying in the parking area outside.Tetiana, who declined to provide her last name, was sure that more death was on the way.“We are being encircled. We understand that,” added Tetiana, who has lived for 10 years in Kramatorsk, a city with a prewar population of around 150,000 people and once one of the industrial hearts of the Donbas. She said she would not leave because she must look after her 82-year-old mother, who is ailing. But she knows more than ever the danger that brings.“We think we will be swept off the face of the earth,” she said.She recalled ducking inside a nearby market on Friday to take cover when the missile struck the train station, with what she estimated was 2,000 people inside. A family that took shelter with her at the market was almost crushed by a piece of a falling roof that was sheared off in the blast.“There were screams everywhere,” she said. “Nobody could understand anything, cars were burning and people were running.”With Moscow’s decision to shift the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine, the people who remain in Kramatorsk fear that they will soon be shelled into oblivion, like the residents of Kharkiv and Mariupol, two other cities that have been ruthlessly assaulted by Russian forces. It feels like an assault here is inevitable: Cutting off Kramatorsk would partly cut off Ukrainian forces fighting in the eastern breakaway regions where Russia is consolidating.At the city’s main hospital, City Hospital 3, the staff was preparing for the kind of destruction that has swept over other urban centers. Their supplies for mass trauma are ample, one doctor said. But, he added, many of the nurses have evacuated and there was a shortage of critical care physicians.In Kramatorsk, residents have started to hunker down, preparing for a siege. Most small shops have been closed, a few grocery stores remain open and the city square, once teeming with people during these warm spring days, is all but empty.Just after noon on Sunday, Tetiana closed the small candy and coffee confectionery where she worked. It would be shuttered for the foreseeable future, as its main source of income, the train station’s passengers, were gone.Still, orange-vested maintenance workers tried to clean around the wreckage from the strike: parts of the train station itself, people’s shoes, a bag of potatoes and broken glass. A pack of stray dogs, frequent visitors to the area around the station, limped around the debris. The workers swept where they could until a water truck arrived, hosing down the blood that had pooled by the outside entrance.In the distance, the thud of artillery reverberated, barely loud enough to hear but still easily felt.“We’re closing down,” Tetiana said. “There is no point.

One resident said that buses sent from western Ukraine were already leaving unfilled. Those who were staying in Kramatorsk, many of them older residents, were bracing what may lie ahead: making do without electricity, living in cold damp basements, cooking by fire and enduring the terror of incoming artillery fire.But on Sunday, Lidia, 65, and Valentyna, 72, dear friends, dressed in nice clothes and decided to leave their lifelong homes together.

They are, in most cases, just a loud single horn that seems inescapable, whether indoors or out.

For now, the Russian front line traces like a jaw around the two cities.Encircling and cutting off Kramatorsk and Sloviansk would allow the Russians to isolate the Ukrainian forces that are holding their old front lines in the two breakaway regions — a maneuver, if successfully carried out, that would mean disaster for the Ukrainian military, as much of their forces are there.Sgt. Andriy Mykyta, a soldier in Ukraine’s border guard, was in Kramatorsk to try to head off that fate.“There will be a serious fight,” Sergeant Mykyta said. “This is a tactic of the Russians: They take cities as hostages.”On Sunday, as he bought an energy drink and some snacks from one of the remaining open grocery stores in the city, the sergeant looked much like every other uniformed Ukrainian service member: a blue stripe on his arm, weathered boots and a jagged tattoo jutting above his collar.But he was, in fact, one of the most valuable members of the Ukrainian armed forces, a part of the select group that was quickly trained by NATO forces (a several-day course that was supposed to last at least a month, he said) to use some of the more complicated weapons that were helping push back Russian forces: the Javelin and NLAW antitank systems.But he played down the missile systems’ importance, saying, “These weapons are like a doughnut at the end of the day.” He said that the real fight would come down to whatever side could withstand its enemy’s artillery the longest and who retained the will to fight.“They have tanks and artillery, but their troops are demoralized,” he said.Maria Budym, a 69-year-old resident of Kramatorsk, shrugged off the artillery and the evacuations. She was staying. When Russian-backed separatists briefly held Kramatorsk in 2014, they were welcomed to the city by some of the pro-Russian population before being driven off by Ukrainian defenders, she said.This time, she added, the Russians will have to deal with her.“Only cowards and people already displaced by the war have fled the city,” she said, standing in a blue fleece pullover in front of her hollowed-out Soviet-style apartment. “Our soldiers will defend this city to their last breath.”Besides, Ms. Budym added, with anger in her eyes: “I have a pipe in my apartment. I’ll use it on whoever comes in that door.”Tyler Hicks contributed reporting.","TheNewYorkTimes: 2022-04-10 After the deadly strike on the train station in Kramatorsk, Ukraine, those who stayed behind are grim about the future: “We think we will be swept off the face of the earth.”By Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Natalia YermakPhotographs by Tyler HicksKRAMATORSK, Ukraine — Two days after more than 50 people were killed on its platforms by a missile strike, the only sounds at the Kramatorsk railway station on Sunday morning were a distant air-raid siren and the rhythmic sweeping of broken glass.“The town is dead now,” said Tetiana, 50, a shopkeeper who was working next to the station when it was attacked as thousands of people tried to board trains to evacuate the eastern city, fearing it would soon be besieged by Russian forces.Friday’s strike was a gruesome turn for the city after nearly eight years of being near the front line of the country’s struggle against Russia-backed separatists in the region known as Donbas.The station’s main hall was still filled with streaks of blood and luggage on Sunday morning, with the burned-out hulks of two sedans lying in the parking area outside.Tetiana, who declined to provide her last name, was sure that more death was on the way.“We are being encircled. We understand that,” added Tetiana, who has lived for 10 years in Kramatorsk, a city with a prewar population of around 150,000 people and once one of the industrial hearts of the Donbas. She said she would not leave because she must look after her 82-year-old mother, who is ailing. But she knows more than ever the danger that brings.“We think we will be swept off the face of the earth,” she said.She recalled ducking inside a nearby market on Friday to take cover when the missile struck the train station, with what she estimated was 2,000 people inside. A family that took shelter with her at the market was almost crushed by a piece of a falling roof that was sheared off in the blast.“There were screams everywhere,” she said. “Nobody could understand anything, cars were burning and people were running.”With Moscow’s decision to shift the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine, the people who remain in Kramatorsk fear that they will soon be shelled into oblivion, like the residents of Kharkiv and Mariupol, two other cities that have been ruthlessly assaulted by Russian forces. It feels like an assault here is inevitable: Cutting off Kramatorsk would partly cut off Ukrainian forces fighting in the eastern breakaway regions where Russia is consolidating.At the city’s main hospital, City Hospital 3, the staff was preparing for the kind of destruction that has swept over other urban centers. Their supplies for mass trauma are ample, one doctor said. But, he added, many of the nurses have evacuated and there was a shortage of critical care physicians.In Kramatorsk, residents have started to hunker down, preparing for a siege. Most small shops have been closed, a few grocery stores remain open and the city square, once teeming with people during these warm spring days, is all but empty.Just after noon on Sunday, Tetiana closed the small candy and coffee confectionery where she worked. It would be shuttered for the foreseeable future, as its main source of income, the train station’s passengers, were gone.Still, orange-vested maintenance workers tried to clean around the wreckage from the strike: parts of the train station itself, people’s shoes, a bag of potatoes and broken glass. A pack of stray dogs, frequent visitors to the area around the station, limped around the debris. The workers swept where they could until a water truck arrived, hosing down the blood that had pooled by the outside entrance.In the distance, the thud of artillery reverberated, barely loud enough to hear but still easily felt.“We’re closing down,” Tetiana said. “There is no point. There are no people.”Evacuation vehicles were still leaving the city but not at the volume they had in the days before. One resident said that buses sent from western Ukraine were already leaving unfilled.

What happened in Kramatorsk, Ukraine recently? 

### assistant:;
A missile strike at the train station in Kramatorsk, Ukraine, resulted in over 50 fatalities. The strike took place while the station was crowded with people attempting to evacuate the city for fears of an imminent siege by Russian forces. The incident has caused fear and despair among remaining residents who believe that more attacks are impending and that they might be “swept off the face of earth.” The town's situation is critical, with employees evacuating and shortages of critical care physicians. The majority of small shops are closed and the city square is largely vacant. The primary source of income for many local businesses, the train station’s passengers, have gone, reducing activity in the area. Despite ongoing evacuations, many of the remaining residents, primarily older citizens, are preparing for what may come next, namely living without electricity, survivng in cold, damp basements, cooking by fire, and enduring potential artillery fire. The news was reported on by TheNewYorkTimes on 2022-04-10."

""We kept hearing things like, ‘We really want to offer this because it's an important perk. But if the funds are going to invest in oil companies, that’s a problem.'""Part of the challenge for these founders, and anyone else interested in sustainable investing, is widespread greenwashing among so-called ESG funds. Funds that claim to use some sort of ESG strategy now number more than 800 and manage more than $3 trillion in assets. But multiple studies and journalistic investigations have shown many do not live up to their environmental, social and governance claims. For example, in August, researchers at InfluenceMap, a London-based climate change think tank, found that 70 percent  of funds with ESG labels are misaligned with global climate targets. When they co-founded Carbon Collective in November 2020, Stein and Regulinski set out to offer a transparent alternative to these funds to individual investors who want their investments aligned with the climate transition. Now, in response to the demand they encountered from employers, the San Francisco-based startup has added a 401(k) version of its strategy aimed at mission-driven companies with under 300 employees.The 401(k) plan offers three investment options: A traditional Vanguard target-retirement portfolio; a Vanguard ESG portfolio; and Carbon Collective’s own ""core climate portfolio ."" The latter offers a suite of fixed income and equity investment funds, including U.S. Treasury and green bond index funds, a variety of low-carbon economy ETFs and the Carbon Collective ""climate only"" fund, which screens out fossil fuel-dependent companies and screens in climate solutions.    ""In order to address climate change, we need to dramatically increase investments in climate solutions,"" Stein said.Over the last few years, concerns about the climate crisis and other societal challenges have fueled record-breaking inflows into ESG mutual funds, with assets poised to reach $41 trillion by the end of this year, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates . Surveys among 401(k) participants reflect this demand as well. A recent poll conducted by As You Sow and Data for Progress found that a plurality of likely U.S. voters, 53 percent, across the political spectrum don’t want their retirement savings invested in fossil fuel companies. Only 24 percent favored fossil fuel investments in their 401(k); the remaining 23 percent said they didn’t know. Similarly, a 2021 survey  done by Schroders found that nearly 70 percent of participants who either didn’t have or weren’t aware of an ESG option in their retirement plan said they might contribute more to their 401(k) if one were available.Despite the demand, though, the vast majority of employer sponsored 401(k)s still don’t offer sustainable fund options. Fidelity Investments, which oversees $3.2 trillion in retirement plans, provides ESG options to 19.4 percent of the 401(k) and 403(b) plans it manages, a Fidelity spokesperson said in an email. And Empower Retirement, which provides custodial services to 71,000 retirement plans with $1.1 trillion in assets, puts the number of those plans offering ESG options at roughly 6,000 . The reason more 401(k)s don’t offer sustainable investment options boils down to caution. Retirement plan fiduciaries and their consultants have always been notoriously conservative and risk-averse. And the fact that the industry has been particularly litigious, targeted by class-action lawsuits  over fees and conflicts of interest, only reinforces that tendency.  Still, the number of 401(k)s that include ESG funds was slowly increasing — until 2020, when a new rule from the Department of Labor under the Trump administration gave plan sponsors another reason for caution. The regulation said fiduciaries could only consider investment factors such as risk and return, not ESG factors, when choosing 401(k) funds, and it explicitly disallowed employers from automatically enrolling workers into an ESG-focused fund. The Biden Labor Department plans to reverse the rule with a proposed regulation  that is in its comment period. The final rule is expected by mid-year. A reversal seems likely to increase the number of employers looking to add an ESG option to their 401(k)s, which makes transparency among these funds all the more important. And regulators appear poised to take action. In response to investor concerns, the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to clamp down  on investment fund greenwashing.   For its part, Carbon Collective hopes to strike a blow for transparency by using a simple strategy that eschews fossil fuels and, in the case of its climate-only index fund, invests in climate solutions. The fund begins with a baseline passive U.S. equity strategy that mirrors the Russell 3000 Index. It then uses negative screening to eliminate companies that are dependent on the long-term use of fossil fuels for their core business, a group that makes up roughly 20 percent of the index: oil companies; airlines; airplane manufacturers; some utilities; petrochemical companies; and steel and cement manufacturers. The fund then reinvests that 20 percent in its own index of climate solutions stocks , which currently includes 169 names.Based on the work of Project Drawdown, the index comprises more than 30 stock categories taken from the climate solutions nonprofit’s exhaustive list . Some of the climate-only fund’s larger holdings (and their categories) include: QuantumScape (batteries); Johnson Controls (building automation); Tesla Motors and Nio (electric vehicles); ABB Ltd (electrical infrastructure); Exelon (green energy); Carrier Global (heat pumps); Plug Power (hydrogen); Applied Materials (LED lights); LKQ (metals recycling); Waste Management (methane digestion); Oatly (plant-based diet); Enphase Energy (solar energy); Zoom (telepresence); and Xylem (water conservation).  Carbon Collective screens out companies largely based on their last year’s revenue and how much of it came directly from fossil fuels, or fossil fuel-dependent activity. For example, General Electric is the second largest manufacturer of wind turbines in the world, Stein said, but the company didn’t get past the screen because last year it generated more revenue from its natural gas and jet engine businesses.""We do not look at climate commitments, or anything like that,"" he added. ""Because talk is very cheap in this space. We believe what you did last year is the best indicator of what you're going to do going forward.""","GreenBiz: 2022-04-06 Not long after Zach Stein and James Regulinski co-founded Carbon Collective, an online investment adviser aimed at environmentally conscious investors, they started hearing from the founders of other mission-driven companies — people who didn’t much like the idea of investing in fossil fuels. ""Our founder friends [in the climate tech world] were really struggling to find 401(k) programs,"" Stein told GreenBiz.

Fidelity Investments, which oversees $3.2 trillion in retirement plans, provides ESG options to 19.4 percent of the 401(k) and 403(b) plans it manages, a Fidelity spokesperson said in an email. And Empower Retirement, which provides custodial services to 71,000 retirement plans with $1.1 trillion in assets, puts the number of those plans offering ESG options at roughly 6,000 . The reason more 401(k)s don’t offer sustainable investment options boils down to caution. Retirement plan fiduciaries and their consultants have always been notoriously conservative and risk-averse. And the fact that the industry has been particularly litigious, targeted by class-action lawsuits  over fees and conflicts of interest, only reinforces that tendency.  Still, the number of 401(k)s that include ESG funds was slowly increasing — until 2020, when a new rule from the Department of Labor under the Trump administration gave plan sponsors another reason for caution. The regulation said fiduciaries could only consider investment factors such as risk and return, not ESG factors, when choosing 401(k) funds, and it explicitly disallowed employers from automatically enrolling workers into an ESG-focused fund. The Biden Labor Department plans to reverse the rule with a proposed regulation  that is in its comment period. The final rule is expected by mid-year. A reversal seems likely to increase the number of employers looking to add an ESG option to their 401(k)s, which makes transparency among these funds all the more important. And regulators appear poised to take action. In response to investor concerns, the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to clamp down  on investment fund greenwashing.   For its part, Carbon Collective hopes to strike a blow for transparency by using a simple strategy that eschews fossil fuels and, in the case of its climate-only index fund, invests in climate solutions. The fund begins with a baseline passive U.S. equity strategy that mirrors the Russell 3000 Index. It then uses negative screening to eliminate companies that are dependent on the long-term use of fossil fuels for their core business, a group that makes up roughly 20 percent of the index: oil companies; airlines; airplane manufacturers; some utilities; petrochemical companies; and steel and cement manufacturers. The fund then reinvests that 20 percent in its own index of climate solutions stocks , which currently includes 169 names.Based on the work of Project Drawdown, the index comprises more than 30 stock categories taken from the climate solutions nonprofit’s exhaustive list . Some of the climate-only fund’s larger holdings (and their categories) include: QuantumScape (batteries); Johnson Controls (building automation); Tesla Motors and Nio (electric vehicles); ABB Ltd (electrical infrastructure); Exelon (green energy); Carrier Global (heat pumps); Plug Power (hydrogen); Applied Materials (LED lights); LKQ (metals recycling); Waste Management (methane digestion); Oatly (plant-based diet); Enphase Energy (solar energy); Zoom (telepresence); and Xylem (water conservation).  Carbon Collective screens out companies largely based on their last year’s revenue and how much of it came directly from fossil fuels, or fossil fuel-dependent activity. For example, General Electric is the second largest manufacturer of wind turbines in the world, Stein said, but the company didn’t get past the screen because last year it generated more revenue from its natural gas and jet engine businesses.""We do not look at climate commitments, or anything like that,"" he added.

Who founded Carbon Collective and what is the purpose of the startup?
### assistant:;
Zach Stein and James Regulinski co-founded Carbon Collective, an online investment adviser catering to environmentally conscious investors. The aim of their platform is to offer a transparent alternative to greenwashing in so-called ESG funds (Environmental, Social, and Governance). Carbon Collective strives to align its investments with the climate transition and has recently added a 401(k) version of its strategy for mission-driven companies with fewer than 300 employees, due to demand. The information was reported by GreenBiz on April 6, 2022. 

### human: 
What are the three investment options of the 401(k) plan offered by Carbon Collective? 
### assistant:;
The 401(k) plan offered by Carbon Collective offers three investment options: a traditional Vanguard target-retirement portfolio; a Vanguard ESG portfolio; and Carbon Collective’s own ""core climate portfolio"". The latter includes a variety of fixed income and equity investment funds, U.S. Treasury and green bond index funds, low-carbon economy ETFs, and the Carbon Collective ""climate only"" fund. This fund excludes fossil fuel-dependent companies and includes companies offering climate solutions, as reported by GreenBiz on April 6, 2022.

What are the main difficulties and challenges for mission-driven companies when it comes to investing?
### assistant:;
A main challenge for mission-driven companies when investing is the prevalent greenwashing among so-called ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) funds. There are more than 800 funds claiming to use an ESG strategy, managing over $3 trillion in assets. However, many of these funds may not truly meet their environmental, social and governance claims. A study by InfluenceMap found that 70% of funds labeled as ESG were misaligned with global climate targets. Furthermore, there is also a struggle to find 401(k) programs that do not invest in fossil fuel companies. This data was shared in an article by GreenBiz, published on April 5, 2022.

What's the growth rate of demand for ESG mutual funds and what are people's opinions towards fossil fuel investments?
### assistant:]:
There has been a record-breaking inflow into ESG mutual funds due to increased concerns about the climate crisis and other societal challenges. Assets in these funds are expected to reach $41 trillion by the end of the year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. A poll conducted by As You Sow and Data for Progress revealed that 53% of likely U.S. voters across the political spectrum did not want their retirement savings invested in fossil fuel companies, while only 24% favored such investments. A 2021 survey by Schroders found that around 70% of those who were unaware of an ESG option in their retirement plan said they might contribute more to their 401(k) if such an option were made available. However, even with this demand, many employer-sponsored 401(k)s still do not offer sustainable fund options. This information was included in a news article published by GreenBiz on April 5, 2022.

What is Carbon Collective's investment strategy and how do they select companies for their climate-only index fund?
### assistant<|im_sep|>Carbon Collective adopts a simple investment strategy that entirely avoids fossil fuels and actively invests in climate solutions, particularly within its climate-only index fund. The strategy begins with a baseline passive U.S. equity strategy reflecting the Russell 3000 Index and uses negative screening to exclude companies reliant on the long-term use of fossil fuels for their core business. This includes oil companies, airlines, airplane manufacturers, some utilities, petrochemical companies, and steel and cement manufacturers, which constitute about 20% of the index. That 20% is then reinvested into Carbon Collective's own index of climate solutions stocks. To determine their holdings, the company screens out businesses largely based on the revenues they received in the previous year from fossil fuels or fossil fuel-dependent activities. The company selects stocks based on concrete evidence rather than future promises, asserting that what a company did the previous year is the best indicator of future behavior.

630dd1b71e19420c59ea652c,ThreeBLMedia,Commitment,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Girls and STEM,https://www.3blmedia.com/news/impact-covid-19-pandemic-girls-and-stem,2022-03-08,Applied Materials,"At Applied Materials, we are entering our fourth year of the Applied Materials Foundation’s Generation GirlTM initiative, a U.S. program focused on inspiring girls to pursue their dreams and equipping them with the academic and socioemotional support they need to succeed. A unique component of this work is funding the enhanced capacity of the girl-serving sector, including underwriting research examining the status of girls in America.\nEarlier this fall, the Applied Materials Foundation and KLA Foundation joined together to support the release of Alliance for Girls’ new report, Uniting Isolated Voices: Girls and Gender-Expansive Youth During COVID-19, which unearths the challenges girls have faced over the last 18 months. Of the over 1200 girls and non-binary youth surveyed across California: \nAlmost half of all respondents (44%) said they had more caregiving responsibilities at home than before the pandemic and nearly one third (31%) of girls with extra duties reported that these additional responsibilities negatively affected their education. \n30% of girls said they couldn’t receive the educational support they needed; and \n12% reported they didn’t have a safe place to live. \nIt comes as no surprise that responses were greatly impacted by race and income level, with girls from low-income backgrounds and girls of color being most negatively affected by the pandemic. While the survey results are specific to California, the findings match what we have heard from girl-serving organizations across the country: girls are resilient, but this pandemic has pushed them to the limit. They feel isolated and disconnected. They are concerned about college and their future. And they are facing increased stresses due to food insecurity, lack of safe and supportive housing, and inequitable access to technology.\nThis report, and others like it, serve as the proverbial canary in the coalmine for those of us committed to increasing the number of women, and specifically Black, Latinx and Indigenous women, in STEM.  \nAs we look towards recovery, there is an opportunity for reflection and action. Too often, companies seeking to grow the pipeline of diverse talent turn to STEM programs as the golden ticket: if she learns to code, she is on track to pursue a career in technology.

A unique component of this work is funding the enhanced capacity of the girl-serving sector, including underwriting research examining the status of girls in America.\nEarlier this fall, the Applied Materials Foundation and KLA Foundation joined together to support the release of Alliance for Girls’ new report, Uniting Isolated Voices: Girls and Gender-Expansive Youth During COVID-19, which unearths the challenges girls have faced over the last 18 months. Of the over 1200 girls and non-binary youth surveyed across California: \nAlmost half of all respondents (44%) said they had more caregiving responsibilities at home than before the pandemic and nearly one third (31%) of girls with extra duties reported that these additional responsibilities negatively affected their education. \n30% of girls said they couldn’t receive the educational support they needed; and \n12% reported they didn’t have a safe place to live. \nIt comes as no surprise that responses were greatly impacted by race and income level, with girls from low-income backgrounds and girls of color being most negatively affected by the pandemic. While the survey results are specific to California, the findings match what we have heard from girl-serving organizations across the country: girls are resilient, but this pandemic has pushed them to the limit. They feel isolated and disconnected. They are concerned about college and their future. And they are facing increased stresses due to food insecurity, lack of safe and supportive housing, and inequitable access to technology.\nThis report, and others like it, serve as the proverbial canary in the coalmine for those of us committed to increasing the number of women, and specifically Black, Latinx and Indigenous women, in STEM.  \nAs we look towards recovery, there is an opportunity for reflection and action. Too often, companies seeking to grow the pipeline of diverse talent turn to STEM programs as the golden ticket: if she learns to code, she is on track to pursue a career in technology. And while that is true for some, what the Uniting Isolated Voices report emphasizes is that the “girls’ COVID-19 landscape is rich and complex, and as a result, [girls’] needs are complex as well.” \nFunding STEM programs for girls without also prioritizing wraparound support services for girls and their families is an incomplete strategy.

New fabs will need to produce greater numbers of increasingly complex chips built with more exacting processes—while also using less power and generating fewer emissions. Fortunately, Applied Materials’ engineers and scientists signed up for this challenge several years ago, and we are making more progress each quarter.\nThis is the second in a series of blog posts about how fabs are being conceived and equipped in new ways to promote a sustainable industry. In the previous post, my colleagues examined the support equipment that resides below the production floor in an area known as the sub-fab and explained how Applied’s iSystem™ can improve efficiencies, reduce emissions and lower energy consumption for chipmakers such as TSMC.\nThis post examines Applied’s efforts to drive fab sustainability through the process chambers, systems and software that we develop for chipmakers. More sustainable fabs will require new generations of equipment, and it all starts with an evolution in the mindset of how these systems are designed.\nDefining “Performance” to Include Sustainability\nImproving “Performance” is one of the most commonly expressed goals in chipmaking. Engineers focus on maximizing scorecard criteria including tool throughput, process uniformity and electrical characteristics, to name a few. Applied now includes sustainability on its performance scorecards and designs systems with a focus on minimizing:\nEnergy consumption,\nThe environmental impact of chemical use, and\nFootprint intensity, or the amount of cleanroom space needed per unit of wafers processed\nIn 2018, Applied created its Design for Sustainability Center of Excellence to help lead the semiconductor industry to identify cleaner, greener manufacturing methods. Using proprietary modeling tools, our experts develop power and emissions reductions strategies for process equipment during the design phase, well before the first piece of metal is cut to build a prototype. Creating digital models also enables new ideas to be applied to existing products already in the field. With these capabilities, we can model both the energy and chemical use in wafer processing in terms of equivalent CO2 emissions, enabling a real-world, holistic view of the impact of our reduction efforts.\nIn 2020 we upped the ante by announcing our “3 by 30” initiative for manufacturing systems. On a per-wafer basis, Applied is targeting a 30-percent reduction in equivalent energy consumption, environmental impact of chemical use and cleanroom area requirement—all by 2030.\nModeling Produces Insights\nCalculating equipment energy needs encompasses many factors beyond just the direct electricity demands of the system. For instance, many systems need to be cooled with chilled water that is produced outside the cleanroom and pumped throughout the fab. That means energy savings can come from designing more thermally efficient systems to reduce the need for chilled water as well as improving the efficiency of chillers and heat exchangers. The SEMI organization’s S23 guidelines establish standards for this type of equivalent energy conversion in semiconductor manufacturing equipment. For example, the guidelines provide that every 1,000 liters of ultra-pure water usage is responsible for 9.0 kWh of energy needed to purify water to fab specifications, giving us a means to quantify the energy savings from reducing water use. Applied Materials has long had a voice in setting these industry standards. In fact, some of them were drafted by the engineering manager who recruited me to Applied.\nDigital models of fab tools that include the equivalent energy demands of key components provide a more comprehensive view of the energy landscape of the fab and are invaluable in helping chipmakers identify how to reduce energy consumption effectively and without affecting other performance metrics.\nMinimizing Chemical Impact\nMore efficient chemical use in semiconductor processing is a worthy goal, but deciding whether one chemical is more important to conserve than another is not always straightforward. To help address this issue Applied developed a framework for modeling the impact of our systems’ chemical use in relation to that chemical’s contribution to global warming.\nLife Cycle Inventory (LCI) data that model CO2 emissions generated over a material’s production cycle (from raw material extraction through delivery to end-use location) is available for many chemicals our products commonly use. Even inert gases such as helium and argon, which are not greenhouse gases, have carbon emissions associated with their production and transport to a fab—which is sometimes called the “cradle-to-gate” footprint. For example, available LCI data from Sphera show that helium is about eight times more carbon intensive than an equivalent volume of argon. These insights help our engineers conceive greener recipes during process development.\nOur framework also considers the emissions from our process chambers after abatement (or the “gate-to-grave” footprint). Detailed studies have quantified the Global Warming Potential (GWP) relative to CO2 of several greenhouse gases used in semiconductor manufacturing (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: 100-year time horizon global warming potential for fluorocarbons and other greenhouse gases commonly used throughout the semiconductor industry, relative to CO2 by mass.\nWe combine these models to compose our cradle-to-grave view of chemical use (see Figure 2) and help to identify the best opportunities to reduce overall environmental impact. We share our analyses with customers so they can apply this knowledge in their own sustainability efforts.\n\nFigure 2: Cradle-to-grave envelope captures global warming impact from the production and transport of input chemicals, and wafer processing emissions following abatement.\nSmall is Big\nFootprint is an important—but sometimes underappreciated—leverage point for improving fab sustainability. Simply put, a system with a smaller cleanroom footprint makes more efficient use of shared, energy-consuming resources such as air conditioning, piping and materials. Additional gains can be made by increasing the throughput of systems of a given footprint.\nWe are working on system designs for some of our major product categories that can deliver a 20-percent reduction in footprint per unit of wafers processed. These improvements will in turn help our customers meet their own sustainability goals, making each new wave of capacity expansion more eco-efficient.\nIt Takes an Industry\nCreating a more sustainable semiconductor industry is a global, cooperative challenge, and the metrics used in our 3 by 30 initiative will guide Applied in making better design decisions for our chambers, systems and process technologies. \nThe global economy needs more semiconductors, and virtually every chipmaker has new fabs on the drawing board.  We are committed to working with our customers and suppliers to drive greater sustainability in the fab, below the fab, and throughout the value chain upstream and downstream of Applied Materials.

What is Applied Materials' strategy to promote sustainability in the semiconductor industry and what goals do they have set for 2030?

### assistant:absolute: 
Applied Materials is driving sustainability in the semiconductor industry by focusing on reducing energy consumption, minimizing the environmental impact of chemical use, and decreasing the footprint intensity, which is the amount of cleanroom space required per unit of wafers processed. In 2018, they set up the Design for Sustainability Center of Excellence to identify cleaner, greener manufacturing methods. Using modeling tools, they are creating strategies for reducing power use and emissions during the design phase of process equipment. Digital models are also being used to apply new ideas to existing products. Furthermore, in 2020, Applied Materials announced its ""3 by 30"" initiative, with the goal of achieving a 30-percent reduction in equivalent energy consumption, environmental impact of chemical use and cleanroom area requirement on a per-wafer basis by 2030. They are committed to working with customers and suppliers to drive sustainability in semiconductor fabrication. The news was published on ThreeBLMedia on 2022-02-08 by Benjamin Gross, Ph.D.

630dd2141e19420c59ea68c2,ThreeBLMedia,Commitment,Improving the Climate Impact of a Growing Business,https://www.3blmedia.com/news/improving-climate-impact-growing-business,2022-02-08,Applied Materials,"The accelerating digital transformation of the economy is creating new levels of demand for semiconductors. As the chip shortages have demonstrated, semiconductors are more important to the world now than ever before. Applied Materials is mobilizing its entire team to meet this unprecedented need for our equipment and technical knowhow.\nWhile this growth is certainly good news for the company’s revenue, it presents many challenges with managing our energy consumption and greenhouse gas footprint. In other words, it’s a good problem for the ESG team to solve.\nDespite these challenges, Applied Materials was pleased to see our recently released 2020 CDP Climate score improve from B- to B when compared with 2019. This keeps us well above the overall CDP average.\nThe reasons for this improvement are straightforward. Although our revenue grew 18% from fiscal 2019 to 2020, our Scope 1 and 2 combined footprint grew just under 5%. Careful management of our footprint is aligned with the company’s ambitious goals to cut Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030.\nTo help achieve that goal, Applied has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA), putting enough new wind power on the grid to offset our entire North American footprint by the end of 2022. In fact, the White Mesa, Texas PPA is already online and has been delivering clean energy as of the fourth quarter of calendar 2021.

As the chip shortages have demonstrated, semiconductors are more important to the world now than ever before. Applied Materials is mobilizing its entire team to meet this unprecedented need for our equipment and technical knowhow.\nWhile this growth is certainly good news for the company’s revenue, it presents many challenges with managing our energy consumption and greenhouse gas footprint. In other words, it’s a good problem for the ESG team to solve.\nDespite these challenges, Applied Materials was pleased to see our recently released 2020 CDP Climate score improve from B- to B when compared with 2019. This keeps us well above the overall CDP average.\nThe reasons for this improvement are straightforward. Although our revenue grew 18% from fiscal 2019 to 2020, our Scope 1 and 2 combined footprint grew just under 5%. Careful management of our footprint is aligned with the company’s ambitious goals to cut Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030.\nTo help achieve that goal, Applied has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA), putting enough new wind power on the grid to offset our entire North American footprint by the end of 2022. In fact, the White Mesa, Texas PPA is already online and has been delivering clean energy as of the fourth quarter of calendar 2021.

Early in his career he focused on the fallout from the nation’s multiple civil wars, which forced him to migrate to France in the 1980s. But in the aftermath of the conflict that concluded in 2010, he has shifted his attention to other social ills.With his newest drama, “Lingui, the Sacred Bonds,” which debuted at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival and reached American theaters on Friday, he takes on the topic of abortion through the plight of a Muslim woman, Amina (Achouackh Abakar Souleymane), who is helping her teenage daughter, Maria (Rihane Khalil Alio), terminate her pregnancy after a sexual assault. The film has received rave reviews, with The Times’s Manohla Dargis making it a Critic’s Pick.While abortion is in theory legal in Chad under strict circumstances, the stigma (often associated with religious beliefs) and restrictions around it push some to resort to clandestine clinics or, worse, to carry to term and then kill the newborn.In a joint interview, Haroun, speaking from Paris, and Abakar Souleymane, in N’Djamena, Chad, shared more on the relevance of their second film collaboration. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.Why did you decide to make this film at this moment in Chad?MAHAMAT-SALEH HAROUN I read an article about a newborn child discovered in the garbage, and all these situations of unwanted pregnancies. But I was first really traumatized by the same subject when I was a child. I was 7 or 8, and we found a baby in the garbage. Several decades later when I read this article, I said, “That’s not normal. I have to do something.” I started investigating, asking nurses, and I discovered that it was a huge problem women are facing every day, because the fact is that in Chad, in our local languages, the word “rape” doesn’t exist. We know that rape exists, a lot of women are victims of it, but there is no word to express it. It’s always as if it’s the women’s fault, like they are guilty because they are pregnant. Sometimes they deny the pregnancy or sometimes, when they discover it’s too late to even think of an abortion, they keep it secret until they have the kid and then they kill it because they don’t have any solutions. I had to tell that story from a Chadian point of view in a human way that resonates with the same problems in the United States, in Argentina, in El Salvador, and in other countries in Africa.ACHOUACKH ABAKAR SOULEYMANE It’s horrible because if you’re not married and you are pregnant, you cannot talk about it. Sometimes these young women are just on their own. If you’re raped, you don’t talk about it, you just deal with it. As a woman, as a single mom, I was happy to be that person that can show it to the whole country and tell women that if this happened in your life, it’s happening to a lot of other women, and you can do something about it.Did you or the film face any pushback from government officials or religious groups?HAROUN When we were in Cannes, people said a lot of things against the film on social media, but they hadn’t seen it. But then when we showed the film in Chad, no one said anything because it’s just the reality. We even have some support from the government. I remember the Ministry of Culture was very happy and we had also a state minister at the screening. He called my assistant the day after and said he wanted to organize his own screening for the whole government because he thought that the film should be shown to all those people who don’t know a lot about this subject. I refused because you never know with politics; sometimes you are manipulated. But it was really well received and even for Achouackh, who being in Chad you might think she could be a victim of hate, she has only received congratulations.ABAKAR SOULEYMANE People would come up to me and say, “You are so brave for being able to do that.” That was shocking.Haroun, you remain the only feature director in Chad with international visibility. In terms of logistics does it continue to be as difficult to produce film in the country as when you started out?HAROUN It’s very difficult to shoot in Chad because we don’t have a real industry. We don’t have real technicians. All the people who work with me in Chad have other jobs, and then when I shoot they come back. We also don’t have professional actors. Sometimes the pressure of society is so strong that you cannot find women who accept to be naked or to kiss someone in a film. When I was looking for the actor for the role of Amina, I met a 40-year-old single mother. I said, “Do you want to act in my film?” And she said, “I’m very interested but I first have to ask my uncles.” In our society, the uncles on your mother’s side have to take care of you. So I said, “If you are not free to make it, forget about it.” This is the situation. Then, of course, we don’t have financing there. I’m always looking for money everywhere, and then go back to Chad to make a film because it’s a duty for me. It’s a responsibility. I’m the only active filmmaker there and if I stop making films in Chad, the world will be missing images from my country.Achouackh, what was your path into “Lingui” and into acting in general?ABAKAR SOULEYMANE I’m an entrepreneur, so I have a restaurant. After high school I studied journalism and now I’m learning sociology. I do a lot of things, but I always wanted to act. I left Chad when I was, like, 17, worked in fashion in California, and I came back 13 years later. I met Haroun in 2012 when he was prepping for “GriGris” [his 2013 drama]. I was assistant costume, and then I got to have a little role in it. I hoped the next time around I could have a bigger part, but I never thought I could have the main role in a movie. I watch a lot of movies, and it was a dream, but I’m a Chadian woman, and I know that in Chad this is not something that you do, so I didn’t really try to pursue it and then it happened. I was almost 40, so I thought, “It’s now or never.”Could you elaborate on the meaning of the “lingui,” a Chadian concept referring to this unspoken union between people, which in the film seems to concern women specifically?HAROUN Lingui is a precept for living together. It concerns everybody in society and it starts with your neighbors. It’s based on tenderness between everyone in the community to resist violence. This mother and daughter only have this love with all the other women. They share the same experiences with their bodies — of being pregnant — and this lets them understand that they belong to the same community and they have the same destiny, so they have to help each other. The lingui is not dead among women, but men, because of power, they forget about it. ABAKAR SOULEYMANE In Chadian society, when there is an issue women only have each other, because there are things that you can’t share with the men. Women have got each other’s backs here and that is powerful.","TheNewYorkTimes: 2022-02-04 As Chad’s most lauded auteur, the director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun remains committed to portraying his sub-Saharan African homeland onscreen.

Who is Chad's most prominent director and what is the focus of his most recent drama?
### assistant: 
Chad's most lauded director is Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, who is best known for portraying his sub-Saharan African homeland onscreen. Haroun's latest drama, entitled ""Lingui, the Sacred Bonds"", presents a story about abortion through the plight of a Muslim woman, Amina (Achouackh Abakar Souleymane), who is helping her teenage daughter, Maria (Rihane Khalil Alio), terminate her pregnancy following a sexual assault. The film has been acclaimed and premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival before reaching American theaters on Feb 04, 2022 (New York Times).
### human: 
What societal issues does ""Lingui, the Sacred Bonds"" address?
### assistant: 
""Lingui, the Sacred Bonds"", directed by Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, tackles the stigma and challenges surrounding abortion in Chad, often linked to religious beliefs. The film also highlights issues related to rape and unwanted pregnancies, bringing attention to a larger societal problem where the word ""rape"" doesn't exist in local languages and victims can often end up blaming themselves for their situations. The film aims to shed light on this from a Chadian perspective, but also in a way that resonates internationally (The New York Times, February 4, 2022). 

### human: 
Was there any pushback from government officials or religious groups after the release of the film ""Lingui, the Sacred Bonds""?
### assistant: 
According to the film's director, Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, there was initially some negative reaction on social media when the film was screened at Cannes. However, when the film was shown in Chad, it was met with largely positive responses as it was seen as a depiction of reality. The Ministry of Culture and a state minister even supported the film, with the latter wanting to organize a screening for the entire government. The film was well received overall and instead of any hate, the film’s lead actress Achouackh Abakar Souleymane only received congratulations (The New York Times, February 4, 2022).
### human: 
What are the obstacles to filmmaking in Chad as explained by Haroun?
### assistant: 
Director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun explains that filmmaking in Chad is challenging due to the lack of a solid film industry and professional technicians. The people who work on his films often hold other jobs and temporarily participate when he is shooting. In addition, finding actors who are able to commit to certain roles can be difficult due to societal pressure and norms - for example, finding women who are comfortable being unclothed or kissing someone in a film. Furthermore, there's a scarcity of financing within the country, so Haroun often sources funds from outside to produce his films in Chad (The New York Times, February 4, 2022). 
### human: 
What is the significance of the term ""lingui"" in Chadian society as portrayed in the film ""Lingui, The Sacred Bonds""?
### assistant: 
In Chadian society, ""lingui"" is a precept that refers to the unspoken bond of community and tenderness between people as a means of resisting violence. Director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun explains this concept becomes particularly poignant among women, as shared experiences and hardships such as pregnancy create commonality and empathy. In the film, the bond between the mother and her daughter, as well as other women, is underpinned by the concept of ""lingui"". As women often rely on each other for emotional support and help in situations unshared with men, the principle of ""lingui"" becomes a powerful survival and resilience mechanism (The New York Times, February 4, 2022)."

Kramer,"KRAMATORSK, Ukraine — A member of the Ukrainian National Guard opened fire at an aerospace and rocket factory on Thursday, killing five people, the authorities said, and raising anxiety in a region already on tenterhooks as tensions with Russia grow.Little was known about the soldier behind the attack or his motive, but given the nature of the tightly guarded factory and warnings in recent days that Moscow might stage an act of sabotage as a pretext for invading Ukraine, the shooting drew immediate attention.The attack took place in Dnipro, one of the largest cities in the country, more than 100 miles from the front line of the war in eastern Ukraine, where the military has been fighting Russian-backed separatists since 2014.The gunman fled the scene, leading to a sprawling manhunt that lasted for hours before a suspect was taken into custody, according to the police. The man was identified as Artemiy Ryabchuk, and the authorities said he was born in 2001 but released few other details.The investigation was taking place against the backdrop of a geopolitical struggle.The Kremlin has been pushing to reduce the Western presence in a region it considers within its sphere of influence, repositioning troops to increase pressure and demanding assurances that NATO will not allow Ukraine to become a member. Earlier this month, the United States said Russia had dispatched intelligence agents and saboteurs into eastern Ukraine to stage a provocation, with industrial infrastructure seen as a potential target.That made the site of Thursday’s attack of special interest.The shooting took place at what was once one of the Soviet Union’s largest missile factories. American officials have long seen the factory, commonly known as Yuzhmash, as posing a risk of weapons proliferation.The Ukrainian police said that the gunman opened fire shortly before 4 a.m., as soldiers were collecting their weapons in a guard house. There were 22 people in the room at the time, the authorities said.Four of those killed were soldiers, and the fifth was an employee of the factory, the police said. Five other people were wounded.A statement from Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that the soldier had turned his weapon on fellow service members who were guarding the plant, and then fled. It said he had fired “for undetermined reasons.”Later, Denys Monastyrsky, Ukraine’s interior minister, wrote in a post on Facebook that the police were examining the suspect’s medical records since the time of his enlistment, suggesting that the investigation would include the possibility of a psychological disorder.The attack came only hours after the United States and NATO provided written responses to Russian demands concerning Western nations’ presence in former Soviet states.

The man was identified as Artemiy Ryabchuk, and the authorities said he was born in 2001 but released few other details.The investigation was taking place against the backdrop of a geopolitical struggle.The Kremlin has been pushing to reduce the Western presence in a region it considers within its sphere of influence, repositioning troops to increase pressure and demanding assurances that NATO will not allow Ukraine to become a member. Earlier this month, the United States said Russia had dispatched intelligence agents and saboteurs into eastern Ukraine to stage a provocation, with industrial infrastructure seen as a potential target.That made the site of Thursday’s attack of special interest.The shooting took place at what was once one of the Soviet Union’s largest missile factories. American officials have long seen the factory, commonly known as Yuzhmash, as posing a risk of weapons proliferation.The Ukrainian police said that the gunman opened fire shortly before 4 a.m., as soldiers were collecting their weapons in a guard house. There were 22 people in the room at the time, the authorities said.Four of those killed were soldiers, and the fifth was an employee of the factory, the police said. Five other people were wounded.A statement from Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that the soldier had turned his weapon on fellow service members who were guarding the plant, and then fled. It said he had fired “for undetermined reasons.”Later, Denys Monastyrsky, Ukraine’s interior minister, wrote in a post on Facebook that the police were examining the suspect’s medical records since the time of his enlistment, suggesting that the investigation would include the possibility of a psychological disorder.The attack came only hours after the United States and NATO provided written responses to Russian demands concerning Western nations’ presence in former Soviet states.

Who recently opened fire at an aerospace and rocket factory in Ukraine, and what were the consequences?
### assistant:;
A member of the Ukrainian National Guard named Artemiy Ryabchuk fired at an aerospace and rocket factory in Dnipro, Ukraine, killing five people including four soldiers and one factory employee and wounding five other people. The incident took place on January 27, 2022. An investigation was underway as the suspect was taken into custody after a sprawling manhunt lasting several hours. This event has raised anxiety in a region already dealing with rising tensions with Russia as the factory is tightly guarded and the authorities had been warned of possible sabotage staged by Moscow to justify an invasion of Ukraine (source: The New York Times). 

### human:
How has this shooting impacted the geopolitical scenario involving Ukraine and Russia?
### assistant:;
This shooting has added a layer of anxiety to an already tense scenario in the region. As the attack occurred at a significant aerospace and rocket factory located over 100 miles from the war's front line with Russian-backed separatists, it drew immediate attention. Given that Moscow has been suspected of potentially staging acts of sabotage as a pretext for invading Ukraine, and the geopolitical struggle involving the Western presence in the region and the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO, this incident has garnered significant interest. U.S. officials have long seen this factory, known as Yuzhmash, as a potential risk for weapons proliferation. This shooting took place just a few hours after the U.S. and NATO provided responses to Russian demands about the Western presence in former Soviet states (source: The New York Times, January 27, 2022).

### human:
What is the significance of the place where the shooting took place?
### assistant:';
The shooting took place at the Yuzhmash factory, which was once one of the Soviet Union's largest missile factories. It has been a place of concern for Western officials due to the risk of weapons proliferation. Its historical significance along with its current role of making civilian rockets for satellite launches contribute to its import. After Ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear weapons in 1993, Western scientists were sent to this facility to help destroy the nuclear weapons. However, there continued to be worries about the spread of missile technology given the availability of technical libraries and poorly paid rocket scientists at the facility. This event took place on January 27, 2022 at this particular factory, adding to the growing tensions in the geopolitical landscape involving Ukraine, Russia, and the West (source: The New York Times)."

Dr. Boyd said over 1,000 fabs operate globally today, together producing over $500 billion worth of chips and about 50 million metric tons of CO2 each year. An advanced fab with a capacity of 50,000 wafer starts per month consumes roughly a terawatt-hour of electricity per year, close to what’s consumed by a city of 100,000 residents—like Santa Clara, California where Applied is headquartered.

What is the global economy experiencing in relation to silicon availability and what is the industry's response to these conditions? 

### assistant:;
The global economy is recovering and recognizes it heavily depends on silicon, which is currently facing a shortage. In response to this, governments worldwide are aiming to relieve the chip shortages and the semiconductor industry is planning major capacity expansions. This includes commitments of hundreds of billions of dollars to construct new fabs globally. These new fabs will distinguish themselves not just by feature size, but also their focus on sustainability. Some companies, like Applied Materials, support this sustainability-minded capacity expansion, and are exploring ways to improve the efficiency of sub-fabs, the support equipment that consumes nearly half of the energy required by modern fabs. This efficiency improvement could lead to reductions in energy, water, and chemical consumption, as well as decrease carbon emissions. This was reported by ThreeBLMedia on January 26, 2022."

On November 18th, 2021, many significant updates occurred in the financial markets according to the Wall Street Journal. Nvidia posted record sales due to increased demand for video games and data centers. Lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret and department store Kohl's exceeded earnings expectations, while Cisco Systems provided a weaker-than-expected outlook for Q2. In the EV sector, startups Lucid Group and Rivian Automotive saw their stocks fall for a second consecutive day, while Tesla's stock continued to increase. Chinese e-commerce firms Alibaba and JD.com showed diverging results; Alibaba's profit fell due to losses from changes in equity investment prices, while JD.com showed a net loss but an increase in revenue. Macy's revealed potential plans to separate its e-commerce business from its brick-and-mortar operation. BJ's Wholesale Club also beat earnings forecasts and approved a share buyback program of up to $500 million. Elsewhere, Deere’s workers ended a month-long strike by ratifying a new six-year contract, and Bath & Body Works, now a standalone business, reported lower earnings and sales but projected higher fourth-quarter earnings."

6311d29bbcc3a2533b7ee1db,TheNewYorkTimes,Report,"The Fisherwomen, Chevron and the Leaking Pipe",https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/world/africa/nigeria-fisherwomen-chevron.html?searchResultPosition=679,2021-11-02,Ruth Maclean and Yagazie Emezi,"To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android.GBARAMATU, Nigeria — When the tide rose under the rickety wooden house-on-stilts of Onitsha Joseph, a fisherwoman who lives above the twisting rivers of the Niger Delta in southern Nigeria, it brought a slick of crude oil.Before long, she saw dead fish floating on oil inches thick, and fishing — her livelihood — became impossible. The fumes were so strong at one point that Ms. Joseph fainted. She was rushed to the hospital on a speedboat.At first, she had no idea where it was coming from. Then, out with some other fisherwomen one day in February, she said they spotted something bubbling up to the river’s surface. Ms. Joseph steered her oil-blackened canoe closer.Far below her snaked a pipe. The American oil giant Chevron laid that pipe 46 years before, according to many neighbors of Ms. Joseph who were there at the time, and now, they said, it was leaking.So began a battle between Chevron and hundreds of fisherwomen in the Niger Delta. Chevron denies that oil was spilling from its pipes. But the women insisted that this was just another instance of oil companies refusing to take responsibility, and decided to take the fight to the oil company’s doors.“You want to kill us with your oil,” Ms. Joseph said, growing emotional. “We’ll come to you so you can kill us yourselves. In person.”Oil companies like Chevron, Shell and Eni have made billions in profits in the vast Niger Delta region in the last decades. But now some are pulling out — and they are leaving utter ruin in their wake, according to government monitors and environmental and human rights organizations. The delicate ecosystem of the Niger Delta, once teeming with plant and animal life, is today one of the most polluted places on the planet.It is the women, who do most of the fishing in the creeks and marshes in this part of the Niger Delta, who are trying to call the oil companies to account.When they found the ominous bubbling, the fisherwomen alerted local leaders, who informed Chevron’s Nigerian subsidiary. At first, Chevron ignored them, the local leaders said, and oil continued to flow through the line.Soon, black oil stained the roots of the mangroves — saltwater-loving trees that act as nurseries for fish and shellfish.The fisherwomen decided it was time to occupy Chevron.Hundreds of women from 18 communities, including Ms. Joseph, arrived at three Chevron facilities on March 26. There were new mothers with babies on their backs, and great-grandmothers in their 80s. In this riverine world, some zoomed in on speedboats. Others paddled to fortresslike flow stations on hand-carved canoes.They climbed up Chevron’s ladders.They scaled Chevron’s wire fences, dropping down on the other side.They shook palm fronds and banged plastic bottles, singing protest songs.Then they settled in to wait.They vowed to occupy the facilities until Chevron did a proper investigation into the spill’s cause.Years of living with oil pollution made them resolute. Nigerian government agencies have counted tens of thousands of oil spills from many sources in the Niger Delta in the past 15 years — though data on spills varies widely. Tens of millions of barrels were spilled since production started in the 1950s, a 2011 study said — quadruple the volume spilled in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster.For years, the women had felt cheated by Chevron, the dominant oil company in their immediate area. Their villages were poor. Houses of zinc and wood barely kept out the elements. Bathrooms were flimsy shacks over the river.By contrast, the Chevron facilities they were occupying were like small cities. They even produced electricity, though they didn’t share it.“From here to Chevron, it’s less than two miles. If they weren't wicked, they’d have brought electricity here,” said Akasaere Mila, an 82-year-old community elder in Kokodiagbene, a village near the spill site. “Chevron’s a very rich company, but they’re very wicked to us.”NIGERNIGERIANIGERIALagosKokodiagbene  Detail areaWarriGBARAMATUregionNIGER DELTANiger R.Port HarcourtBelemaGulf of Guinea30 milesBy The New York TimesOnce, Mrs. Mila visited Chevron’s office in Warri, a city several hours away by boat. It is a low, unremarkable office block — but to Mrs. Mila, it seemed the height of luxury.“It’s a very fantastic building, with air conditioning, light 24 hours a day,” she said. “Water comes out of the faucet. You don’t have to go out to buy food, they have it right there. And they’re getting the money for that from this place.”This wasn’t the first time a mass-scale all-women protest had shut down company infrastructure and caused a commotion.In 2017, over 100 miles southeast of Gbaramatu, across a vast tangle of mangroves and rivers, the women of Belema protested against Shell. After years of underdevelopment and unemployment, they wanted Shell to hand over its oil field to a local businessman, Tein Jack-Rich.They occupied Shell facilities for nearly two years. It worked. Mr. Jack-Rich’s company, Belemaoil, took over operations and maintenance from Shell.The women there did not get rich. But before Covid-19, Mr. Jack-Rich employed over 1,000 local people, awarded scholarships and built roads and wells, said Anabs Sara-Igbe, a prominent chief, asserting that the investment in the community “far exceeds what we have seen from Shell and Chevron throughout all the years they’ve operated.”Those years may be drawing to a close.The world is moving on from fossil fuels. After decades of extraction, major oil companies are gradually leaving the Niger Delta altogether or going offshore — but, environmentalists said, often without decommissioning their aging infrastructure, which is done to restore the environment and prevent pollutants from leaching.“They are moving out and leaving all the mess behind,” said Celestine AkpoBari, a prominent environmentalist. “They are happy to sell the liability to whoever wants to buy, and run away.”The fisherwomen didn’t want Chevron out. They could barely imagine life without Chevron. The company extracts oil in partnership with Nigeria’s federal government, which is heavily dependent on oil revenue. The government and the oil companies were seen as almost synonymous — sometimes benevolent, sometimes malevolent — doling out crumbs of the national cake, or not. But not something that could be gotten rid of.The women just wanted the company to stop the pipe from leaking, to investigate — which could lead to compensation — and some sacks of cassava or rice to tide them over until they could fish again.At night at Chevron’s flow stations, the fisherwomen slept on hard metal walkways, plagued by mosquitoes.

The fumes were so strong at one point that Ms. Joseph fainted. She was rushed to the hospital on a speedboat.At first, she had no idea where it was coming from. Then, out with some other fisherwomen one day in February, she said they spotted something bubbling up to the river’s surface. Ms. Joseph steered her oil-blackened canoe closer.Far below her snaked a pipe. The American oil giant Chevron laid that pipe 46 years before, according to many neighbors of Ms. Joseph who were there at the time, and now, they said, it was leaking.So began a battle between Chevron and hundreds of fisherwomen in the Niger Delta. Chevron denies that oil was spilling from its pipes. But the women insisted that this was just another instance of oil companies refusing to take responsibility, and decided to take the fight to the oil company’s doors.“You want to kill us with your oil,” Ms. Joseph said, growing emotional. “We’ll come to you so you can kill us yourselves. In person.”Oil companies like Chevron, Shell and Eni have made billions in profits in the vast Niger Delta region in the last decades. But now some are pulling out — and they are leaving utter ruin in their wake, according to government monitors and environmental and human rights organizations. The delicate ecosystem of the Niger Delta, once teeming with plant and animal life, is today one of the most polluted places on the planet.It is the women, who do most of the fishing in the creeks and marshes in this part of the Niger Delta, who are trying to call the oil companies to account.When they found the ominous bubbling, the fisherwomen alerted local leaders, who informed Chevron’s Nigerian subsidiary. At first, Chevron ignored them, the local leaders said, and oil continued to flow through the line.Soon, black oil stained the roots of the mangroves — saltwater-loving trees that act as nurseries for fish and shellfish.The fisherwomen decided it was time to occupy Chevron.Hundreds of women from 18 communities, including Ms. Joseph, arrived at three Chevron facilities on March 26. There were new mothers with babies on their backs, and great-grandmothers in their 80s. In this riverine world, some zoomed in on speedboats. Others paddled to fortresslike flow stations on hand-carved canoes.They climbed up Chevron’s ladders.They scaled Chevron’s wire fences, dropping down on the other side.They shook palm fronds and banged plastic bottles, singing protest songs.Then they settled in to wait.They vowed to occupy the facilities until Chevron did a proper investigation into the spill’s cause.Years of living with oil pollution made them resolute. Nigerian government agencies have counted tens of thousands of oil spills from many sources in the Niger Delta in the past 15 years — though data on spills varies widely. Tens of millions of barrels were spilled since production started in the 1950s, a 2011 study said — quadruple the volume spilled in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster.For years, the women had felt cheated by Chevron, the dominant oil company in their immediate area. Their villages were poor. Houses of zinc and wood barely kept out the elements. Bathrooms were flimsy shacks over the river.By contrast, the Chevron facilities they were occupying were like small cities. They even produced electricity, though they didn’t share it.“From here to Chevron, it’s less than two miles. If they weren't wicked, they’d have brought electricity here,” said Akasaere Mila, an 82-year-old community elder in Kokodiagbene, a village near the spill site. “Chevron’s a very rich company, but they’re very wicked to us.”NIGERNIGERIANIGERIALagosKokodiagbene  Detail areaWarriGBARAMATUregionNIGER DELTANiger R.Port HarcourtBelemaGulf of Guinea30 milesBy The New York TimesOnce, Mrs. Mila visited Chevron’s office in Warri, a city several hours away by boat. It is a low, unremarkable office block — but to Mrs. Mila, it seemed the height of luxury.“It’s a very fantastic building, with air conditioning, light 24 hours a day,” she said. “Water comes out of the faucet. You don’t have to go out to buy food, they have it right there. And they’re getting the money for that from this place.”This wasn’t the first time a mass-scale all-women protest had shut down company infrastructure and caused a commotion.In 2017, over 100 miles southeast of Gbaramatu, across a vast tangle of mangroves and rivers, the women of Belema protested against Shell. After years of underdevelopment and unemployment, they wanted Shell to hand over its oil field to a local businessman, Tein Jack-Rich.They occupied Shell facilities for nearly two years. It worked. Mr. Jack-Rich’s company, Belemaoil, took over operations and maintenance from Shell.The women there did not get rich. But before Covid-19, Mr. Jack-Rich employed over 1,000 local people, awarded scholarships and built roads and wells, said Anabs Sara-Igbe, a prominent chief, asserting that the investment in the community “far exceeds what we have seen from Shell and Chevron throughout all the years they’ve operated.”Those years may be drawing to a close.The world is moving on from fossil fuels. After decades of extraction, major oil companies are gradually leaving the Niger Delta altogether or going offshore — but, environmentalists said, often without decommissioning their aging infrastructure, which is done to restore the environment and prevent pollutants from leaching.“They are moving out and leaving all the mess behind,” said Celestine AkpoBari, a prominent environmentalist. “They are happy to sell the liability to whoever wants to buy, and run away.”The fisherwomen didn’t want Chevron out. They could barely imagine life without Chevron. The company extracts oil in partnership with Nigeria’s federal government, which is heavily dependent on oil revenue. The government and the oil companies were seen as almost synonymous — sometimes benevolent, sometimes malevolent — doling out crumbs of the national cake, or not. But not something that could be gotten rid of.The women just wanted the company to stop the pipe from leaking, to investigate — which could lead to compensation — and some sacks of cassava or rice to tide them over until they could fish again.At night at Chevron’s flow stations, the fisherwomen slept on hard metal walkways, plagued by mosquitoes. Occasionally, they paddled home to change clothes. Their lives were on pause.Their impact was plain, though. Chevron says it shut off the flow of oil to its pipes in the area. The leak stopped, the women said.After about 10 days, local male leaders asked them to leave.

What happened with the fisherwomen of the Niger Delta region in Nigeria when crude oil started to affect their livelihood and environment?

### assistant:'
In Southern Nigeria, a situation developed with the fisherwomen of the Niger Delta region due to a large-scale oil spill which prevented them from fishing as they usually did. Fisherwoman Onitsha Joseph observed this when the tide rose under her house-on-stilts and brought a slick of crude oil, leading to her witnessing dead fish floating on oil and forcing her to stop fishing. She faint due to the strong fumes and later discovered a pipe, reportedly laid by the American oil giant Chevron 46 years ago, bubbling up oil into the river's surface. The fisherwomen then started a battle against Chevron, which influences their lives heavily but neglects to their needs. Their homes are in poor condition while Chevron facilities are modern, producing even electricity. In an effort to expose the company, hundreds of women from 18 communities occupied three Chevron facilities starting from March 26. Their aim was to make Chevron investigate the spill which could lead to possible compensation and immediate relief items. Chevron did respond by switching off the flow to its pipes in the area, but then the leaks stopped. The women were then asked to leave the facilities by local male leaders who said that Chevron had promised an investigation. However, after leaving, no one from Chevron arrived for the promised investigation, and the community spiraled into ethnic conflict between the Itsekiris and the Ijaws over who should represent their community should a joint investigation take place. The conflict also delayed the joint investigation and potential compensation. While Chevron's response to the situation was that their surveillance showed there was no leak from their facilities. As a result of the unpractical solutions, some of the affected women contemplated protesting once again. (source: The New York Times, 2021-11-02)"

Friedman,"Ever since Deng Xiaoping opened China to the world in the late 1970s, many in the West wanted to see the country succeed, because we thought China — despite its brutal authoritarian political structure — was on a path to a more open economy and society. Alas, President Xi Jinping has reversed steps in that direction in ways that could pose a real danger to China’s future development and a real danger to the rest of the world.Everything Xi is doing today is eroding trust among Chinese and foreign entrepreneurs about what the rules of business are now inside China, while at the same time eroding trust abroad that China — having swallowed Hong Kong — won’t soon move on Taiwan, which could trigger a direct conflict with the U.S.While I don’t want Xi’s hard-line strategy to succeed — that would pose a danger to every free country and economy in the Pacific — I also don’t want China to fail or fracture. We’re talking about a country of 1.4 billion people whose destabilization would affect everything from the air you breathe to the cost of your shoes to the interest rate for the mortgage on your house. It’s a real dilemma. Alas, though, I don’t think Xi realizes just how much uncertainty his recent behavior has injected — inside and outside China.For those of you who have not been keeping score at home, let me explain by starting with a question: What would you have thought if you’d looked at this newspaper in 2008, a year after the Apple iPhone was released, and the front-page headline said that Steve Jobs had disappeared? There would be millions of searches on Google: “Where is Steve Jobs?”Well, if China has a Steve Jobs equivalent it’s Jack Ma, the co-founder of the e-retail giant Alibaba. Has anyone seen Ma lately? I guarantee you that more than a few people have asked Google this year, “Where is Jack Ma?”Although news reports said that Ma had surfaced briefly in Hong Kong, there has also been talk that he may have been under some kind of house confinement during the last year. Ever since Ma gave a speech in October 2020 that criticized China’s financial regulators, Xi has cracked down on Alibaba’s global empire and blocked what would have been a record initial public offering of an affiliate company set to have taken place last November.It was as if Xi said: “You know, if I have to choose either having Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and all the other Chinese tech giants be global champions — with their own massive financial and data resources but growing beyond the grasp of the Chinese Communist Party — or having them be second-tier companies under my control, I’ll choose door No. 2.”Xi has clearly watched how Western tech companies have exacerbated social tensions in their societies, widened income gaps and established monopolies that can dominate governments — and he wants none of that unfettered capitalism for China. I get that. But making their founders vanish? More than a few young Chinese innovators have to be asking themselves: “What’s my future here? What are the new rules?”A second story: After the Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, expressed support last April for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, China reacted by slashing its imports of Australian barley, beef, wine and coal. Really? It was an absurd, bullying overreaction that every one of China’s Pacific neighbors noted.Then, two weeks ago, China sent 150 People’s Liberation Army aircraft to probe the airspace near Taiwan, just the latest reminder that China is seriously laying the groundwork to seize Taiwan by force. You should be afraid.But so should Beijing. Because this bullying behavior could be a huge miscalculation by Xi — for many reasons, but none more than this: semiconductors.Yup, those little chips that are the building blocks of the 21st-century digital economy are a hidden underbelly of this drama.Taiwan is an austere rock in a typhoon-laden sea with 24 million people. But this little island has — by universal acclaim — the most sophisticated microchip manufacturer in the world, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC.About 100 miles away, across the straits, is mainland China, with 1.4 billion people. Most are the same ethnicity, speak the same language and eat the same food as the people of Taiwan. But they have never been able to master the manufacture of the most advanced logic chips that TSMC makes.TSMC is the world’s largest contract manufacturer of microchips, owning some 50 percent of the market, though Dan Wang, a technology analyst at research firm Gavekal, said in March of TSMC’s market share, “I think that still understates how important it is, because these are some of the most advanced chips out there.”Indeed, TSMC and its South Korean rival Samsung have the only foundries in the world able to make the most advanced 5-nanometer chips, and TSMC is expected to begin next-generation 3-nanometer chips in 2022. The smaller the chip’s transistors, the more brain power you can pack onto it. China’s biggest chip maker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, is not even close. It is mainly competing at 28 nanometers and just starting to produce some 14-nanometer chips.I recently spent time in Silicon Valley asking U.S. chip designers what is the secret of TSMC’s sauce that China cannot replicate.Their short answer: trust.TSMC is a semiconductor foundry, meaning it builds the chips that lots of different companies design — particularly Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD and even Intel. Over the years, TSMC has built an amazing ecosystem of trusted partners that share their intellectual property with TSMC to build their proprietary chips. At the same time, leading tool companies — like America’s Applied Materials and the Netherlands’ ASML — are happy to sell their best chip-making tools to TSMC. This ensures that the company is always on the cutting edge of the material science and lithography that go into building and etching the base of every semiconductor.And since it is the main supplier of chips for Apple products, TSMC is constantly being pushed to go beyond the frontiers of innovation to accommodate Apple’s nonstop and short product cycles for new phones and iPads. It forces the whole TSMC ecosystem to get better and better, faster and faster. So TSMC’s costs keep going down, the value of its ecosystem keeps going up, and the number of people who can join and benefit from it keeps getting larger and larger.“TSMC always acted like a start-up — it was driven — and it was always synthesizing the best of everyone,” explained Steve Blank, a semiconductor innovator, who runs a course at Stanford on the geopolitics of advanced technologies. Intel, America’s premier chip maker, kind of lost its way, making everything by itself and for itself, added Blank. “So it did not have customers pushing it, because Intel was its own customer, and as a result it became complacent.” Pat Gelsinger, Intel’s new C.E.O., has begun to reverse that.I used to worry that Xi’s big idea — “Made in China 2025,” his plan to dominate all the new 21st-century technologies — would leave the West in the dust. But I worry a little less now. I have great respect for China’s manufacturing prowess. Its homegrown chip industry is still good enough to do a lot of serious innovation, supercomputing and machine learning.But the biggest thing you learn from studying the chip industry is that all its most advanced technologies today are so complex — requiring so many inputs and super-sophisticated equipment — that no one has the best of every category, so you need a lot of trusted partners.And if China thinks it can get around that by seizing Taiwan just to get hold of TSMC, that would be a fool’s errand. Many of the key machines and chemicals TSMC uses to make chips are from America and the European Union, and that flow would immediately be shut down.Nope, you can’t make the best chips in the world today without silicon or trusted partners. And everything that Xi is doing — from Australia to Taiwan to Jack Ma — is driving them away. As one U.S. chip executive said to me of Xi, “The Chinese have replicated and mimicked,” but they have never created the kind of ecosystem like TSMC’s, “because there is no trust.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

What actions has Chinese President Xi Jinping taken that have been met with criticism, and what potential consequences could these actions have for China and its relations with the rest of the world?
### assistant:'
On October 20, 2021, The New York Times reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping has received backlash due to moves seen as eroding trust in China, posing potential challenges to the nation's future development and global relations. Xi has notably implemented policies that undermine the confidence of both Chinese and foreign entrepreneurs in their understanding of China's business regulations. Additionally, there is growing international concern over China's intentions towards Taiwan, especially after its active suppression in Hong Kong. An instance of this controversial leadership includes the case of Jack Ma, co-founder of the E-retail giant Alibaba, who disappeared following criticism of China's financial regulators, leading to a crackdown on Alibaba's global empire. Other actions by Xi's administration include retaliation against Australia for its support of an investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic by slashing imports of Australian barley, beef, wine, and coal. Furthermore, China's attempts at dominance in semiconductor manufacturing, largely reliant on Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), could fall short without the trust of crucial international partners. Any attempt to seize Taiwan to gain control of TSMC could prove futile as key machines and chemical sources needed for chip production are U.S. and EU-based, and access to these resources would likely be cut off in such an event (The New York Times, 2021)."
6310e4a88719a4ef8a88fd77,TheNewYorkTimes,Events,U.S. Delivers Another Blow to Huawei With New Tech Restrictions,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/business/economy/commerce-department-huawei.html?searchResultPosition=649,2021-09-24,Ana Swanson,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration issued a new rule Friday that will bar Huawei and its suppliers from using American technology and software, a significant escalation in the White House’s battle with the Chinese telecom giant and one that is likely to inflame tensions with Beijing.The rule change, which is slated to go into effect in September, will block companies around the world from using American-made machinery and software to design or produce chips for Huawei or its entities. Companies can apply for a license to continue supplying those products, but the administration said the presumption would be to deny those requests.John Neuffer, the president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents chip makers, said his group was concerned that the rule would “create uncertainty and disruption for the global semiconductor supply chain.” He added, however, that it appeared less damaging than broader approaches the administration had previously considered.The move appears aimed at inflicting further damage on Huawei, which continues to rely on American-made machinery and software designs to make the chips for its smartphones and tablets, as do the companies that supply it. The Trump administration has singled out Huawei as a threat to national security, saying its gear should not be trusted because it is beholden to the Chinese government, an accusation the company has denied.The measure is the latest of several restrictions taken against Huawei in the last year. The administration added Huawei to an “entity list” last May, barring exports of American products to the company and 114 of its affiliates unless suppliers had first obtained a license.After that rule was imposed, Huawei took steps to reduce its reliance on American chip manufacturers like Qualcomm and ramp up its in-house production through a chip unit, HiSilicon.But HiSilicon still relies on outside manufacturers, including the Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or S.M.I.C., and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or T.S.M.C., to mass-produce chips to its specifications. Many of those operations rely to some extent on technology that was developed and refined in the United States, where the semiconductor industry began.In a statement on Friday, the Commerce Department said Huawei had tried to “undermine” its previous restrictions by using American software and technology to make its own semiconductors, and buying products from foreign foundries that used American equipment.“There has been a very highly technical loophole through which Huawei has been able, in effect, to use U.S. technology with foreign fab producers,” Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said in an interview Friday morning on Fox Business Network. He said the changes announced Friday were tailored moves “to try to correct that loophole and make sure that the American fab foundries are competing on an equal footing with the foreign ones.”The measure could weigh on major chip contract manufacturers that sell to Huawei, particularly S.M.I.C. and T.S.M.C., which rely heavily on American manufacturing tools. It may also clamp down on sales by makers of semiconductor equipment, like Applied Materials, KLA and Lam Research, as well as chip design software companies.The move comes at a moment of heightened tensions between the United States and China. President Trump has blamed China for not doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus and has suggested that the United States may punish the Chinese government. He has also begun threatening to scrap the trade deal the two countries signed in January.“This came from China,” Mr. Trump said at a White House event to discuss a vaccine on Friday. “It should have been stopped in China before it got out to the world.”The administration’s new measure against Huawei, one of China’s biggest technology companies and a crown jewel of Chinese innovation, could prompt a backlash against American technology companies that depend on sales to China, such as Qualcomm and Apple.On Friday evening, the English edition of the Chinese state-controlled newspaper Global Times cited an unnamed source who said the Chinese government was ready to retaliate.“Based on what I know, if the U.S. further blocks key technology supply to Huawei, China will activate the ‘unreliable entity list,’ restrict or investigate U.S. companies such as Qualcomm, Cisco and Apple, and suspend the purchase of Boeing airplanes,” Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Global Times, wrote on Twitter.In a call with reporters on Friday, a State Department official enumerated the United States’ broad concerns about Huawei, including that it had violated American sanctions on Iran and helped the Chinese government construct a surveillance network within China and abroad. Huawei is key to the Chinese government’s broad strategy of “civil military fusion” that supports the Communist Party’s global ambitions, the official said.Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, called the rule change “long overdue.”“The United States needs to strangle Huawei,” he said in a statement. “Modern wars are fought with semiconductors, and we were letting Huawei use our American designs. This is pretty simple: Chip companies that depend on American technology can’t jump into bed with the Chinese Communist Party.”Huawei had no immediate comment.On Thursday night, T.S.M.C. said it had agreed to build a $12 billion factory in Arizona, in response to the Trump administration’s growing concerns about the security of the global electronics supply chain. The twin announcements raised speculation that T.S.M.C. might have obtained some kind of assurance that at least a portion of its sales to Huawei would be exempted from the new ban. While the bulk of T.S.M.C.’s revenue is from American companies, HiSilicon accounted for 14 percent of its revenue in the first quarter and is the company’s fastest-growing client, said Paul Triolo, an industry analyst at Eurasia Group.Keith Krach, the under secretary for economic growth, energy and the environment at the State Department, said Friday that T.S.M.C. had been given “no assurances” that it would be exempt from the measure. A Commerce Department official said the agency did not comment on individual license decisions.A T.S.M.C. spokeswoman said the factory decision was based on its business needs, not part of any negotiation for eased trade sanctions.In a statement early Friday, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo said the deal would increase American economic independence from China and strengthen the U.S. relationship with Taiwan, a self-governing island claimed by Beijing.Also on Friday morning, the Commerce Department extended for another 90 days a license that has allowed American companies to continue doing business with Huawei temporarily.

What new rules has the Trump administration issued regarding Huawei and its suppliers? 
### assistant: 
On September 24, 2021, the Trump administration issued a new rule barring Huawei and its suppliers from using American technology and software. This move was taken as a significant escalation in the White House's battle with the Chinese telecom giant and is expected to inflame tensions with Beijing. The rule blocks companies around the world from using American-made machinery and software to design or produce chips for Huawei or its entities, though companies can apply for a license to continue sharing these products. However, the presumption will be to deny these requests. This rule is set to go into effect in September. This action targeted Huawei since the company was highly dependent upon American-made machinery and software designs to produce chips for its smartphones and tablets. The Trump administration had identified Huawei as a threat to national security because of its connection to the Chinese government. This measure is the latest in a series of restrictions on Huawei in the past year(Source: The New York Times)."

63109ac78719a4ef8a871f18,TheNewYorkTimes,Collaborations ,Venture to Declare,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/18/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2021-07-19.html?searchResultPosition=268,2021-07-18,Rachel Fabi,"MONDAY PUZZLE — Congratulations to the constructor Stephanie Lesser, who is making her debut today with a bit of seasonally appropriate advice! I “venture to declare” that Ms. Lesser’s pro tip is probably timely for many vacationbound crossword solvers who will no doubt see the wisdom in the four-part quip in this puzzle. (Not a spoiler! That this is a quip puzzle is signaled in the clues.)One thing I love about crossword puzzles (among the many, many things I love about crossword puzzles) is the generosity of the community of constructors toward aspiring new constructors. As Ms. Lesser’s notes (below) make clear, her journey into crossword constructing was aided by the support of a slew of seasoned constructors.Between Crossword Twitter, the Crosscord Discord server and the Crossword Puzzle Collaboration Directory, there are more ways than ever before for new constructors to find mentors and collaborators. And if you, dear reader, find yourself considering dipping your toe into the warm, welcoming waters of crossword construction, I hope you will find those links useful!23A. This is tricky only if you are not now and have never been a naughty teenager. “Decorates with bathroom tissue, as in a Halloween prank” is TPS, which is an abbreviation of “Toilet PaperS.”10D. “Large cat you shouldn’t trust on a test?” is some light wordplay and an excuse to go find a picture of CHEETAH cubs because CHEETAH sounds like cheater, a person you might not trust on a test.24D. I think I have played “Words With Friends” every day for the past 10 years of my life, so this wasn’t too tricky for me, but solvers who are unfamiliar with the GAME APP may not know that it is basically Scrabble on your phone.Ms. Lesser’s puzzle, solvers soon realize, is a quip puzzle, meaning that the “theme” entries are all pieces of a witty sentence. The “summery” quip at the center of this puzzle is composed of four parts of equal length that advises vacationers to perhaps leave their furry friends with a particular aquatic name at home. The quip reads:TAKING A DOG / NAMED SHARK / TO THE BEACH / IS A BAD IDEA.Can’t argue with that! I love the mental image of a person calling out to a tiny Maltese named Shark and setting off a panic at the seashore. As an added bonus, Ms. Lesser includes some more thematic material at 3D, with the clue “Relative of a great white” for MAKO.Although quip crossword puzzles are less common now than they once were, people who enjoy these witty observations and clever puns can find more of them in print in The New York Times’s Cryptogram.And now, a word from the debut constructor herself:Yay! Today is my New York Times Crossword puzzle debut! As a new constructor, I learn a lot every day, and enjoy every minute of it.

I “venture to declare” that Ms. Lesser’s pro tip is probably timely for many vacationbound crossword solvers who will no doubt see the wisdom in the four-part quip in this puzzle. (Not a spoiler! That this is a quip puzzle is signaled in the clues.)One thing I love about crossword puzzles (among the many, many things I love about crossword puzzles) is the generosity of the community of constructors toward aspiring new constructors. As Ms. Lesser’s notes (below) make clear, her journey into crossword constructing was aided by the support of a slew of seasoned constructors.Between Crossword Twitter, the Crosscord Discord server and the Crossword Puzzle Collaboration Directory, there are more ways than ever before for new constructors to find mentors and collaborators. And if you, dear reader, find yourself considering dipping your toe into the warm, welcoming waters of crossword construction, I hope you will find those links useful!23A. This is tricky only if you are not now and have never been a naughty teenager. “Decorates with bathroom tissue, as in a Halloween prank” is TPS, which is an abbreviation of “Toilet PaperS.”10D. “Large cat you shouldn’t trust on a test?” is some light wordplay and an excuse to go find a picture of CHEETAH cubs because CHEETAH sounds like cheater, a person you might not trust on a test.24D. I think I have played “Words With Friends” every day for the past 10 years of my life, so this wasn’t too tricky for me, but solvers who are unfamiliar with the GAME APP may not know that it is basically Scrabble on your phone.Ms. Lesser’s puzzle, solvers soon realize, is a quip puzzle, meaning that the “theme” entries are all pieces of a witty sentence. The “summery” quip at the center of this puzzle is composed of four parts of equal length that advises vacationers to perhaps leave their furry friends with a particular aquatic name at home. The quip reads:TAKING A DOG / NAMED SHARK / TO THE BEACH / IS A BAD IDEA.Can’t argue with that! I love the mental image of a person calling out to a tiny Maltese named Shark and setting off a panic at the seashore. As an added bonus, Ms. Lesser includes some more thematic material at 3D, with the clue “Relative of a great white” for MAKO.Although quip crossword puzzles are less common now than they once were, people who enjoy these witty observations and clever puns can find more of them in print in The New York Times’s Cryptogram.And now, a word from the debut constructor herself:Yay! Today is my New York Times Crossword puzzle debut! As a new constructor, I learn a lot every day, and enjoy every minute of it. I hope my love of words comes through and makes a lot of solvers smile.This was the second puzzle that I submitted to The New York Times.

631110668719a4ef8a8a23db,TheNewYorkTimes,Monitoring,The Louvre’s Art Sleuth Is on the Hunt for Looted Paintings,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/arts/design/louvre-art-sleuth-emmanuelle-polack.html?searchResultPosition=778,2021-07-16,Elaine Sciolino,"PARIS — In a frenzied, four-day auction in the grand hall of the Savoy Hotel in Nice in June 1942, buyers bid on paintings, sculptures and drawings from “the cabinet of a Parisian art lover.” Among the 445 pieces for sale were works by Degas, Delacroix, Renoir and Rodin.The administrator monitoring the sale, appointed by the French collaborationist Vichy regime, and René Huyghe, a paintings curator at the Louvre, knew the real identity of the art lover: Armand Isaac Dorville, a successful Parisian lawyer. They also knew that he was Jewish.After Hitler’s armies invaded and occupied Paris in 1940, the Vichy government began to actively persecute Jews. Barred from his law practice, Dorville fled Paris to the unoccupied “free zone” in southern France. He died there of natural causes in 1941.The Louvre’s Huyghe bought 12 lots from Dorville’s collection with government funds on behalf of France’s national museums, and the Vichy authorities seized the proceeds of the entire auction under 1941 “Aryanization” laws that allowed it to take over personal property owned by Jews. Two years later, five of Dorville’s family members were deported and perished in Auschwitz.11 PhotosView Slide Show ›The full history of the Dorville auction might have remained secret had it not been for Emmanuelle Polack, a 56-year-old art historian and archival sleuth. The key to her success in discovering the provenance of works that suspiciously changed hands during the Nazi Occupation was to follow the money.France has faced criticism that it lags behind countries like Germany and the United States in identifying and returning artworks looted during the war years, and, recently, the Louvre has sought to turn its image around. Its goal is to find and encourage the descendants of the works’ original owners to reclaim what is rightfully theirs.“For years I cultivated a secret garden about the art market during the Occupation,” Polack said in an interview. “And finally, it is recognized as a crucial field for investigation.”“The truth makes us free,” Jean-Luc Martinez, the Louvre’s director, said recently.In 2020, he hired Polack as the public face of the museum’s restitution investigations. “When he offered me a job, I said to myself, ‘No, it’s not possible,’” she said. “And then, suddenly, I found myself working in the heart of the Louvre’s collections. It is truly an honor.”In March, the Louvre put a catalog of its entire collection online — nearly half a million artworks. There is a separate category for a mini-collection of more than 1,700 stolen artworks returned to France after World War II that the museum still holds because no rightful owners have come forward. Other French museums hold several hundred more works.Their presence is still an embarrassment for France. After World War II, about 61,000 stolen paintings, sculptures and other artworks were returned; the postwar government swiftly turned over 45,000 of them to survivors and heirs, but sold thousands more and kept the funds. The ones that remain in French museums are sometimes known as the “orphans.”Polack works closely with Sébastien Allard, the head of the Louvre’s paintings department, who for years pressed the French art establishment to do more about finding the owners and heirs of “orphan” paintings, and who in late 2017 curated two small galleries at the museum to show about 30 of the works.Polack is currently studying the provenance of several of those paintings. She combs through the Louvre’s voluminous files, auction catalogs, art gallery and framers’ receipts, catalogues raisonnés and correspondence to track how works of art changed hands over the years. She focuses on the reverse sides of paintings, which often give clues about sales, restorations and framers that might lead back to their owners.“The backs of paintings can be very talkative,” Polack said.She also has begun to study auction catalogs and documents in the Drouot auction house, which opened its archives to the Louvre in March.Polack, who grew up in the upscale Paris suburb of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, brings personal history to her mission. Her maternal grandfather was deported and perished in the Buchenwald concentration camp; her paternal grandfather was a prisoner of war whose possessions were looted by the Nazis.“No one, not my grandparents, not my parents, ever talked about the war,” she said. “The story was transmitted through the unspoken, and there is nothing worse than the unspoken.”Polack learned the basics about the art market from her father, a real estate agent who collected paintings and antique cars and took her to flea markets and auctions when she was a teenager. After specializing in Holocaust studies for her master’s degree, she taught history and geography in a public high school and worked for more than a decade in monument conservation and restoration.Fascinated more by how art works changed hands than by the pieces themselves, she decided to write about the booming art market during the Occupation. But, she said, she knew that the only way to be taken seriously as a research scholar was to get a doctorate in art history.In 2017, at the age of 52, she finally produced a doctoral dissertation — which became a book two years later — on the French art market during the war years.Polack already had made her reputation abroad, as a member of an international task force in Germany following the discovery of around 1,500 works squirreled away by Cornelius Gurlitt, whose father, Hildebrand, bought artworks for Hitler.While working for the task force, she uncovered the key to the Dorville story. She looked at the back of a portrait by the Impressionist painter Jean-Louis Forain and discovered a yellowing label, with an item number from the catalog of auction in Nice. “CABINET d’un AMATEUR PARISIEN,” it read, with no other information about the seller’s identity.Intrigued, she traveled to the city, and uncovered in public archives the sale catalogs, the auction minutes, the identity of the seller and documents proving the involvement of the Vichy government’s Commissariat for Jewish Questions. Working with a genealogical firm, she located and then befriended the Dorville heirs.“Her tenacity, her combativeness is incredible,” said Philippe Dagen, an art historian and critic for Le Monde newspaper who wrote a book on looted art with Polack.“The Indiana Jones of Looted Paintings,” is how Le Point magazine has described her.Nearly eight decades after the auction, the consequences of the sale in Nice continue to haunt France, pitting the French government against Dorville’s heirs, reviving the ugly history of the Louvre’s involvement in a problematic sale and putting Polack in an uncomfortable position.Dorville’s heirs contend that the sale of his artworks was forced under the wartime anti-Jewish laws, making it an illegal act of “spoliation” or looting. They argue that, had the government given them the proceeds from the auction, perhaps the five family members who perished at Auschwitz might have found a way to survive.Polack has long supported the family’s position. In a 2017 Le Monde article, she called the Dorville auction “one of the main sales from looting carried out by the French in World War II.”The French government, by contrast, relying largely on gaps in the evidence about how the auction came to be, arrived at a different conclusion.In May, the government accepted the findings of the commission that examines reparation claims from victims of wartime anti-Jewish laws, which declared that the Dorville auction was carried out “without coercion or violence.”However, because of the Louvre’s involvement, the French government decided that the 12 works bought by the museum should be returned to the Dorville heirs. At the same time, since the government did not declare the sale illegal, several French museums that bought or were given nine additional works from the auction will get to keep them. Under Culture Ministry rules, the Louvre cannot comment on the decision.The irony for Polack is that, as a Louvre employee, she cannot speak freely about it either. “When I arrived, everyone knew who I was, what I was doing, what family I was helping,” she said. “But I will stop there.”The ruling has unleashed a firestorm of criticism among art historians and critics. In an article in the newspaper Le Figaro, Claire Bommelaer, a senior culture correspondent, wrote “What is a sale under duress, if not a sale organized by Vichy, when all the beneficiaries are hunted down, banned from auction rooms and subject to anti-Jewish laws?”The Dorville heirs plan to challenge the government’s decision in a French court. “It wasn’t the Germans who did this,” said Corinne Hershkovitch, a leading art lawyer who represents the family. “The French state must admit that this sale fell under the Aryanization laws of Vichy France. It must recognize that this sale was forced and illegal.”France’s decision is in sharp contrast to a ruling by Germany’s Culture Ministry, which concluded in 2020 that the Dorville auction was a forced sale and returned three works bought there by Gurlitt, Hitler’s art dealer. Polack was present at the 2020 formal restitution ceremony in Berlin.The outcome of the Dorville court case in France could have repercussions for museums in the United States that hold works from the auction, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Yale University’s art gallery and the Minneapolis Institute of Art. The heirs have asked for those to be returned.For Francine Kahn, a 73-year-old biologist and a grandniece of Dorville, it is the reputation of the family that is at stake.“This is not about money,” she said in an interview. “We have a responsibility to honor the memory of the five family members who perished at Auschwitz.”She said that she understands Polack’s silence about a case that helped make her reputation in France. “She cannot say the French government is wrong, even if she may be convinced otherwise,” she said. “As the French say, ‘You don’t spit in the soup.’”","TheNewYorkTimes: 2021-07-16 PARIS — In a frenzied, four-day auction in the grand hall of the Savoy Hotel in Nice in June 1942, buyers bid on paintings, sculptures and drawings from “the cabinet of a Parisian art lover.” Among the 445 pieces for sale were works by Degas, Delacroix, Renoir and Rodin.The administrator monitoring the sale, appointed by the French collaborationist Vichy regime, and René Huyghe, a paintings curator at the Louvre, knew the real identity of the art lover: Armand Isaac Dorville, a successful Parisian lawyer.

Who was Armand Isaac Dorville and what historical event is making his story relevant again? 

### assistant: 
Armand Isaac Dorville was a successful Parisian lawyer and art lover who had a significant collection consisting of works by artists like Degas, Delacroix, Renoir, and Rodin. In 1942, a four-day auction was held at the Savoy Hotel in Nice where 445 pieces from his collection were sold. The proceeds from the sale, however, were seized by the French collaborationist Vichy regime under their 1941 ""Aryanization"" laws. Post his death in 1941, five of Dorville's family members were deported to Auschwitz and perished there. This episode has come to light again because of the efforts of art historian and archival sleuth Emmanuelle Polack, and the Louvre Museum's initiative to return artworks looted during the war years to the descendants of the original owners. As Dorville's family argues that the auction was a forced sale under the wartime anti-Jewish laws, the case is being seen as an attempt to honor the memory of the Dorville family members who died in Auschwitz and restore legal and moral justice.

The largest of these funds very much reflect the spectrum of investors’ choice and preferences, active and index-based approaches, degree of ESG integration and screens based on values and thematics.“They highlight the fact that there is no one way to invest sustainably, as well as demonstrate clearly that different investors may be at different stages in their ESG journey and that their preferences can be quite diverse. A solid understanding of fund ESG policies can be essential in helping investors make the most of their fund decisions.”Mahmood, who previously worked at Nutmeg, added the lion’s share of the top 20 funds were in the active management space, but noted that for flows in 2020 much of this went into index products.Information technology was the largest allocation in most funds, with an almost zero allocation to energy (see exhibit below). This sector-based exposure was one of the key drivers behind the recent short-term outperformance of many ESG funds relative to their non-ESG counterparts, as tech stocks rallied in 2020 while energy declined.The research analysed the top 20 largest funds in the global ESG fund universe, as defined by MSCI, as at 31 December 2020. In total, these funds held $150bn in assets combined, representing 13% of the total assets sitting globally in ESG equity funds.Mahmood noted the funds varied widely tenure and domicile, while the oldest fund is more than 30 years old and the youngest just over five. More than half were domiciled in Europe, but most funds invested in US equities. This, Mahmood said, is likely down to the funds’ high exposure to the information technology sector – it was the largest allocation.Google parent Alphabet was the most commonly held stock with an average weight of 1.9% across 12 of the funds.

But how does that reconcile with real-world carbon emissions? The energy sector tends to score poorly on environmental issues, meaning that funds with energy exposure might have heightened exposure to pollutive companies or higher carbon intensity. Holdings alone do not provide the full picture, however; in fact, there were funds that did not have any energy stocks but exhibited a substantially higher carbon intensity than those that did.”Summarising, he added: “A lot of fund groups have similar ESG policies but very different exposures and inherently different mandates.

### assistant:AddonAssistant<|im_sep|>According to the research by MSCI, the top 20 largest ESG equity funds largely focused on the technology sector and are mostly in the active management space. Despite concerns of greenwashing in the investment industry, it was found that these funds differ greatly in approach, age, and domicile, with their objectives, methodologies, and geographic exposures also varying. Most of the funds were allocated to the information technology sector, whereas an almost zero allocation was directed towards energy. The research analyzed funds holding a combined $150bn assets, which represents 13% of total assets globally in ESG equity funds. The age of these funds varied widely, with the oldest being over 30 years and the youngest slightly over five years old. Google's parent company, Alphabet, was the most commonly held stock. The research also pointed out variation in carbon intensity among these funds. The report emphasized the diversity of ESG fund policies to investors while choosing the fund.

It was the early afternoon of May 15, a Saturday, the Sabbath in this bustling town just east of Tel Aviv.Mr. Franco’s death has drawn little attention. He was a poor Israeli, a loner, had no close family, a neighbor, Ovitz Sasson, said. The victim’s apartment, a single room, measures about 60 square feet. His belongings are still piled inside. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time, far from Gaza, when a brief war paid an unexpected visit.It is the indiscriminate nature of Hamas rocket attacks, designed to create panic and havoc among civilians in random corners of Israel, closing the international airport during the latest 11-day conflict, that enrages many Israelis. What they see, as a Foreign Ministry statement put it Friday, is Hamas “firing from civilian locations inside Gaza, at Israeli civilians.”“My mother moved to a hotel, she’s completely traumatized,” Mr. Sasson said. “How can they do this?”Mr. Franco was one of 12 people killed in Israel; more than 230 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, including 67 children.Almost two weeks after the attack here, a pile of wood, twisted aluminum, broken glass and rubble lies near the rocket’s point of impact on a street now surrounded by damaged three-story apartment buildings. A discarded toilet sits in the debris. Workers busy themselves repairing apartments, hanging blinds, installing new windows in store fronts.Most of the laborers are Palestinians. They have journeyed more than three hours from their homes in the occupied West Bank to fix damage caused by Palestinians in Gaza. They work for Israeli contractors.

What did he think of his situation, repairing what Hamas wrought, for an Israeli boss, against the backdrop of Israeli flags?“That’s life,” he said, with a slight smile. “Nothing changes.”It’s life in the Holy Land, where the absurd always lurks just beneath the tragic, where peace can always be imagined but never implemented, and Jewish and Arab existences are at once conflictual and intertwined.The lines on maps that politicians draw in an attempt to define or resolve the conflict are defied by the fluidity and harsh imperatives of economics. The explosions of war interrupt but do not put an end to this reality.Tzahi Gavry, the Israeli contractor employing the Palestinians, said, “Look, what you see on TV are the hard-liners, but that’s not everything. Some of us also know how to live together. These guys are all OK, I’ve been working with them for years. They do work Israelis do not want to do.”Mr. al-Baqr, 56, who later said he was anxious about revealing his identity, gets up every work day at 3 a.m., takes a bus, negotiates a checkpoint into Israel, and boards another bus to Ramat Gan. He works until about 3 p.m. His round-trip journey takes about seven hours.He said he earns about $185 a day, less $20 for the daily journey and about $150 a month paid to a Palestinian fixer who secures his work permit and his smooth passage through checkpoints into Israel. That is still far more than he could earn in the West Bank. With this he supports a family of six children.His views lie somewhere between pragmatic and resigned. Everyone talks of peace, he suggested, but a small dispute could be enough for another war to begin. Politicians on both sides forget the people they serve; they line their pockets. “We can get along,” he said. “But our governments can’t.”Mr. Gavry said his mother had told him as a child that when he joined the Israel Defense Forces, he would not have to fight because the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be over. “Now my son is 14 and when he serves, he may well see combat,” he said.His thoughts took a somber turn. “We work together, joke together, eat together,” he said, pointing to the Palestinians. “But one day if they are called to defend Jerusalem, all the Muslims will come. In the end, they just don’t want us here.”The rocket that killed Mr. Franco was one of more than 4,000 fired by Hamas from Gaza during the conflict. It might have fallen anywhere and killed anyone. A feature of the repetitive short wars between Hamas and Israel is that Hamas targeting is indiscriminate, while Israel’s often appears disproportionate. Both indiscriminate and disproportionate harm to civilians can constitute war crimes under international law.

Mr. Franco, who suffered from various medical problems, had no fortified room for shelter.“It was Shabbat,” Mr. Sasson said, the Sabbath, which Jews traditionally welcome with candles, wine and a braided loaf of challah. “The challah was on the table when the rocket hit.

Who was killed due to a Hamas rocket attack in Ramat Gan, Israel, on May 15, 2021, and what was the impact on the community?
### assistant:The person who was killed due to a Hamas rocket attack in Ramat Gan, Israel, was Gershon Franco, a 56-year-old who lived in a tiny apartment. Shrapnel from the rocket that penetrated the wooden door of his apartment led to his death on May 15, 2021, a Saturday afternoon. Mr. Franco's death has had a significant impact on the local community. It has drawn attention to the indiscriminate nature of Hamas' attacks, causing havoc and panic and even closing international airports. His death has been especially traumatic for his neighbors, and Mr. Franco's neighbor Ovitz Sasson noted that his mother had to move to a hotel due to trauma. The attack also resulted in damage to nearby buildings, with workers, including Palestinians from the West Bank, repairing the damage caused by the rockets. The rocket that killed Franco was one of more than 4,000 fired by Hamas from Gaza during the conflict (Source: The New York Times, 2021-06-16).

Hoping to limit the carnage, federal officials have shut the gates that feed the project’s sprawling irrigation system, telling farmers the water that has flowed every year since 1907 will not be available.Some farmers, furious about water rights and fearing financial ruin, are already organizing a resistance. “Tell Pharaoh let our water feed the Earth,” said a sign erected near the nearly dry irrigation canal that would usually be flowing with water from Upper Klamath Lake in southern Oregon.The brewing battle over the century-old Klamath Project is an early window into the water shortfalls that are likely to spread across the West as a widespread drought, associated with a warming climate, parches watersheds throughout the region.In Nevada, water levels have dropped so drastically in Lake Mead that officials are preparing for a serious shortage that could prompt major reductions in Colorado River water deliveries next year. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom has placed 41 counties under a state of emergency.While drought consumed much of the West last year, setting the stage for an extensive wildfire season, the conditions this spring are far worse than a year ago. More than half of the West faces “extreme” drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, including wide areas of California and Oregon. Scientists have said the region may be going through the worst drought period in centuries.Here in Oregon, conservationists, Native American tribes, government agencies and irrigators are squaring off, and local leaders fear that generations of tensions could escalate in volatile new ways.“There are folks on both sides that would really like to throw down and take things in an ugly direction,” said Clayton Dumont, a member of the Klamath Tribal Council. “I hope it doesn’t happen, but it’s a possibility.”Some landowners have openly talked about breaching the fence surrounding the dam property and forcing open the irrigation gates. Already, they have purchased property adjacent to the head gates and staged protests there. Ammon Bundy, who led an armed takeover of an Oregon wildlife refuge in 2016, said he was ready to bring in allies to help keep the gates open, saying that people need to be prepared to use force to protect their rights even if law enforcement arrives to stop them.“Who cares if there is violence? At least something will be worked out,” Mr. Bundy said in an interview, ridiculing those not prepared to fight for the nation’s food supply. “‘Oh, we don’t want violence, we’ll just starve to death.’ Heaven forbid we talk about violence.”The region has a deep history rooted in violence and racial division. In 1846, U.S. War Department surveyors, led by John C. Frémont and Kit Carson, slaughtered more than a dozen Native Americans on the shores of Klamath Lake. The Klamath Tribes eventually signed a treaty surrendering some 20 million acres of their historic lands in exchange for a reservation along Upper Klamath Lake and the perpetual right to hunt and fish.For the United States, the Klamath Project became a keystone for settling and developing the region. Homestead opportunities for veterans after the two world wars helped to stimulate the economy and to build a new kind of community.In 1954, Congress moved to terminate recognition of the Klamath Tribes, which held lucrative timberlands, and authorized the sale of tribal lands.And the government’s guarantee to the Klamath Tribes that they would at least be able to continue fishing ran into trouble decades ago, when populations of native sucker fish — known to the tribes as C’waam and Koptu — along with coho salmon farther downriver slipped into a perilous decline, prompting mandatory protections under the Endangered Species Act.During a drought in 2001, the federal Bureau of Reclamation initially planned for the first time to fully cut off water for farmers over the summer. That order spurred an uprising of farmers and ranchers who used saws, torches and crowbars to breach the facilities and open the canal head gates.U.S. Marshals eventually stepped in to protect the gates, and the Bureau of Reclamation later released some water to help farmers.Later that year, three men were charged with going on a racist shooting spree through the town where the Klamath Tribes have their offices.Now some in the basin are worried that the unresolved divisions are poised to erupt again.“These are not things that are going to get better if climate change continues to give us more uncertainty and less reliable supplies of water,” said William Jaeger, an economics professor at Oregon State University who specializes in environmental, resource and agricultural policy issues. He said the drought conditions that emerged in recent decades, in part fueled by declines in snowpack, were likely to happen again in the future — and there needed to be a recognition that the Klamath Basin was overcommitted in its water obligations.This year shows how critical the shortage is already: Even with farmers cut out of the water supply, fish are suffering.Lake levels fell below the minimum thresholds set by federal scientists, prompting litigation and spurring fears that algae blooms this summer could devastate the imperiled fish populations above the dam; tribal researchers say insufficient flushing downstream from the dam has allowed parasites to flourish.Already this year, juvenile salmon are turning up dead with parasitic infections. Michael Belchik, a senior water policy analyst at the Yurok Tribe, said the die-off could end up being the worst on record.“This is really catastrophic,” Mr. Belchik said. “We are starting to talk about the ‘extinction’ word around here.”Tricia Hill, who grows potatoes, onions, mint and other crops across some 14,000 acres in the basin, much of it within the Klamath Project, said the focus on managing individual fish species under threat had failed. Despite 20 years of efforts, including water restrictions for farmers, the fish are still in decline. And, Ms. Hill said, the economy is at a standstill and families are struggling.“It feels really bad to see this much pain and not think that it’s doing a darn bit of good,” Ms. Hill said, standing next to a sprawling patch of desolate land on a family farm that is now in its second season with nothing but scrubby cover crops designed to keep the soil from blowing away. “This is awful — I have cried a ridiculous amount this year,” she said.Also cut off from water supplies this year are several wildlife refuges that are home to 25 at-risk species of birds and fish.Farmers generally have been split on how aggressively to push back against this year’s water shut-off. Ms. Hill said she disliked the idea of forcing open the gates, saying that option would do little to help. Other farmers have also called for ratcheting back the threats.But on Thursday night, about 100 people gathered under a large tent next to the head gates on property bought recently by two farmers, Dan Nielsen and Grant Knoll, who say they have a legal entitlement to the water behind the gates in Upper Klamath Lake under state water law. They contend that the federal government’s shut-off is a violation of state and federal law and the U.S. Constitution.Tribes and irrigators have each notched victories in court over water rights, and the legal cases are continuing.At the event, organized by local activists in Mr. Bundy’s network, speakers talked about the need to take back their rights. Some floated unfounded conspiracy theories, linking the water crisis to George Soros, Bill Gates or the United Nations. A Betsy Ross flag flew above the tent while a poster inside featured a quote about freedom attributed to LaVoy Finicum, who was killed by federal agents during the standoff that Mr. Bundy led in 2016. Mr. Bundy faced federal charges for his role in the standoff but was acquitted by a jury.The local sheriff, Chris Kaber, told the crowd that he attended because he had personal friends in the group but planned to remain publicly neutral in order to keep the peace.Mr. Knoll told the group that the best way to open the head gates would be for the local irrigation district — on whose board he sits — to do it, in defiance of the Bureau of Reclamation. But he said his fellow board members seemed unwilling to take that step.“The next way to open it is you know what,” Mr. Knoll told the crowd. “And that’s where all the fun begins.”Facing a similar standoff two decades ago, in 2001, the federal government relented with a limited delivery of water to farmers, but there was no sign that agencies, facing an already depleted lake, would budge this time. An initial plan to provide a small water allocation to farmers was canceled when conditions worsened.Ms. Hill said she expected that some farmers would be unable to make their mortgage payments this year. Some may file for bankruptcy. Ms. Hill said she expected that her operation would survive this year, but as a fourth-generation farmer, she had begun to wonder whether her daughters would be able to follow in her footsteps.“Farmers, by their nature, are optimists,” she said. “I have to hope, but I’m definitely worried.”","TheNewYorkTimes: 2021-06-08 KLAMATH FALLS, Ore. — Through the marshlands along the Oregon-California border, the federal government a century ago carved a whole new landscape, draining lakes and channeling rivers to build a farming economy that now supplies alfalfa for dairy cows and potatoes for Frito-Lay chips.The drawdowns needed to cover the croplands and the impacts on local fish nearing extinction have long been a point of conflict at the Klamath Project, but this year’s historic drought has heightened the stakes, with salmon dying en masse and Oregon’s largest lake draining below critical thresholds for managing fish survival.

Ms. Hill said she expected that her operation would survive this year, but as a fourth-generation farmer, she had begun to wonder whether her daughters would be able to follow in her footsteps.“Farmers, by their nature, are optimists,” she said. “I have to hope, but I’m definitely worried.”","### human: 
What are the reasons for the current water shortage and conflict in Oregon-California border?

### assistant:absolute:;
The conflict and water shortage at the Oregon-California borders are due to a combination of factors primarily including a historic drought, climate change, and long-standing disputes over water allocation. The drought, which is the worst in centuries, has reduced water supplies for both agricultural and conservation purposes. This has resulted in damage to local fish populations, which were already nearing extinction, and has also strained farmers who rely on the water for their crops. There have also been disputes over water rights dating back a century, with some landowners discussing breaching the fence surrounding the dam property and forcibly opening irrigation gates. Existing tensions in the region are escalating, and there are fears that they could become volatile. This situation is reported in The New York Times, dated 2021-06-08."

While I was in school, a representative from one of the local government agencies came to talk about environmental protections in the mining industry. The representative focused on the wetland reclamation that Mosaic does, and their role as an industry regulator. I thought the mining industry sounded interesting, and I was impressed by the scale on which Mosaic was doing land reclamation. The idea of working somewhere I could make a difference, and the opportunity to work for such an innovative company, is what led me to Mosaic.\nWhen I first started at Mosaic, I spent most of my time using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to analyze the reclamation projects I was tasked with managing. GIS takes a set of attributes and gives them a geographical reference. For example, Mosaic’s mitigation wetlands are shown on a map in GIS. I can view these wetlands and their attributes, such as when was it constructed, what type of wetland it is (forest or herbaceous), etc. This technology was relatively new when I started but continues to advance. When I started in the environmental field I used a cumbersome and hefty GPS unit for data collection in the field. These early GPS units were carried in the field in backpacks and weighed 20-25 lbs. They were used to collect GPS waypoints that could be uploaded back into our GIS software. Now, we have smart phones and drones to make data collection much easier.

A recruiter reached out and said they thought I was a better fit as a reclamation ecologist and asked if I was interested in applying for that position instead. When they sent over the job description, it really was and is, exactly what I wanted to do. It was a combination of working with the regulatory agencies, which appealed to my interests in policy, and working in the field – everything from earth work to establishing entire wetland and upland ecosystems. It touched on all those things that when you are in school you say to yourself, “wouldn’t it be awesome to have a job like that one day.” It was very exciting and spoke to all my hopes and desires of what I wanted in a career.

I have never stopped learning at Mosaic. I get to work on new and interesting projects every day and that is exactly what I wanted out of a career. \nHow does working at Mosaic align with your personal passions or beliefs?We live where we work. There has always been a culture at Mosaic that this is our backyard. We need to do the best job possible – not just because of policy, but because we want to be proud of our backyards. The best thing about my job is when I look at aerial photographs and can see the changes in the landscape that I helped to improve over time. I can see new tree lines, or because of improved hydrology, wetlands returning or forests booming for the same reason. Those are the kinds of things that you can toggle back in time and see the impact that you’ve made. It’s neat to know that not only am I making difference, but a visible difference.

639129917628bb0690a03ce8,TheNewYorkTimes,TSMC,Is There a War Coming Between China and the U.S.?,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/opinion/china-us-2034.html?searchResultPosition=7,2021-04-27,Thomas L. Friedman,"If you’re looking for a compelling beach read this summer, I recommend the novel “2034,” by James Stavridis, a retired admiral, and Elliot Ackerman, a former Marine and intelligence officer. The book is about how China and America go to war in 2034, beginning with a naval battle near Taiwan and with China acting in a tacit alliance with Iran and Russia.I’m not giving it all away to say China and the U.S. end up in a nuclear shootout and incinerate a few of each other’s cities, and the result is that neutral India becomes the dominant world power. (Hey, it’s a novel!)What made the book unnerving, though, was that when I’d put it down and pick up the day’s newspaper I’d read much of what it was predicting for 13 years from now:Iran and China just signed a 25-year cooperation agreement. Vladimir Putin just massed troops on the border of Ukraine while warning the U.S. that anyone who threatens Russia “will regret their deeds more than they have regretted anything in a long time.” As fleets of Chinese fighter jets, armed with electronic warfare technology, now regularly buzz Taiwan, China’s top foreign affairs policymaker just declared that the U.S. “does not have the qualification … to speak to China from a position of strength.”Yikes, that’s life imitating art a little too closely for comfort. Why now?The answer can be found, in part, in a book I have written about before: Michael Mandelbaum’s “The Rise and Fall of Peace on Earth.” It tracks how we went from a world defined by the Cold War between American democracy and Soviet communism — 1945 to 1989 — to a singularly peaceful quarter century without big power conflict, buttressed by spreading democracy and global economic interdependence — 1989 to about 2015 — to our current, much more dangerous era in which China, Iran and Russia are each deflecting the pressures of democracy and the need to deliver constant economic growth by offering their people aggressive hypernationalism instead.What has made this return of Chinese, Iranian and Russian aggressive nationalism even more dangerous is that, in each country, it is married to state-led industries — particularly military industries — and it’s emerging at a time when America’s democracy is weakening.Our debilitating political and cultural civil war, inflamed by social networks, is hobbling Americans’ ability to act in unison and for Washington to be a global stabilizer and institution builder, as the United States was after World War II.Our foolish decision to expand NATO into Russia’s face — after the fall of the Soviet Union — hardened post-Communist Russia into an enemy instead of a potential partner, creating the ideal conditions for an anti-Western autocrat like Putin to emerge. (Imagine if Russia, a country with which we have zero trade or border disputes, were OUR ally today vis-à-vis China and Iran and not THEIR ally in disputes with us.)Meanwhile, the failure of the U.S. interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq to produce the pluralism and decency hoped for after 9/11, coupled with the 2008 economic crisis and the current pandemic — together with the general hollowing out of America’s manufacturing base — has weakened both American self-confidence and the world’s confidence in America.The result? Right when China, Russia and Iran are challenging the post-World War II order more aggressively than ever, many wonder whether the United States has the energy, allies and resources for a new geopolitical brawl.“Just because communism is gone — and we don’t have two political and economic systems that claim universal legitimacy competing to govern every country — doesn’t mean that ideological considerations have disappeared from international politics,” Mandelbaum argued to me.Regimes like those in China, Iran and Russia feel much more threatened — more than we think — by democracy, Mandelbaum added. During the first decade of the 21st century, these regimes were able to generate sufficient public support through economic progress. But after that proved more difficult in the second decade of the 21st century, “the leaders of these countries need to find a substitute, and the one they have chosen is hypernationalism.”Are we up to the challenge? I’m pretty sure we can keep a more aggressive, nationalistic Russia and Iran deterred at a reasonable cost, and with the help of our traditional allies.But China is another question. So we’d better understand where our strengths and weaknesses lie, as well as China’s.China is now a true peer competitor in the military, technological and economic realms, except — except in one critical field: designing and manufacturing the most advanced microprocessors and logic and memory chips that are the base layer for artificial intelligence, machine learning, high-performance computing, electric vehicles, telecommunications — i.e., the whole digital economy that we’re moving into.China’s massive, state-led effort to develop its own vertically integrated microchip industry has so far largely failed to master the physics and hardware to manipulate matter at the nano-scale, a skill required to mass produce super-sophisticated microprocessors.However, just a few miles away from China sits the largest and most sophisticated contract chip maker in the world: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. According to the Congressional Research Service, TSMC is one of only three manufacturers in the world that fabricate the most advanced semiconductor chips — and by far the biggest. The second and third are Samsung and Intel.Most chip designers, like IBM, Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD (and even Intel to some extent) now use TSMC and Samsung to make the microprocessors they design.But, just as important, three of the five companies that make the super-sophisticated lithography machines, tools and software used by TSMC and others to actually make the microchips — Applied Materials, Lam Research Corporation and KLA Corporation — are based in the United States. (The other two are Dutch and Japanese.) China largely lacks this expertise.As such, the American government has the leverage to restrict TSMC from making advanced chips for Chinese companies. Indeed, just two weeks ago, the U.S. made TSMC suspend new orders from seven Chinese supercomputing centers suspected of assisting in the country’s weapons development.The South China Morning Post quoted Francis Lau, a University of Hong Kong computer scientist, as saying: “The sanctions would definitely affect China’s ability to keep to its leading position in supercomputing,” because all of its current supercomputers mostly use processors from Intel or designed by AMD and IBM and manufactured by TSMC. Although there are Korean and Japanese alternatives, Lau added, they are not as powerful.China, though, is doubling down on research in the physics, nanotechnology and material sciences that will drive the next generation of chips and chip-making equipment. But it could take China a decade or more to reach the cutting edge.That’s why — today — as much as China wants Taiwan for reasons of ideology, it wants TSMC in the pocket of Chinese military industries for reasons of strategy. And as much as U.S. strategists are committed to preserving Taiwan’s democracy, they are even more committed to ensuring that TSMC doesn’t fall into China’s hands for reasons of strategy. (TSMC is now building a new semiconductor factory in Phoenix.) Because, in a digitizing world, he who controls the best chip maker will control … a lot.Just read “2034.” In the novel, China gains the technological edge with superior A.I.-driven cybercloaking, satellite spoofing and stealth materials. It’s then able to launch a successful surprise attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet.And the first thing China does is seize Taiwan.Let’s make sure that stays the stuff of fiction.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

What is the novel ""2034"" by James Stavridis and Elliot Ackerman about and why did it unsettle the author of this article? 
### assistant:The novel ""2034"" by James Stavridis, a retired admiral, and Elliot Ackerman, a former Marine and intelligence officer, portrays a future conflict between China and America set in the year 2034, with the narrative beginning with a naval battle near Taiwan and China allying tacitly with Iran and Russia. The book ends with a nuclear shootout between the U.S. and China, leading to neutral India becoming the dominant world power. The author of the article found the novel unnerving because current presence of Chinese fighter jets near Taiwan, the China-Iran cooperation agreement, massing of Russian troops on Ukraine's border and China's audacious foreign policy declarations seemed to be reflective of the novel's predictions.

61c974a9664788d91723635c,ThreeBLMedia,Promotions,Global Citizen Launches a 'Recovery Plan for the World'- a Campaign to End COVID-19 for All and Kickstart a Global Recovery,https://www.3blmedia.com/news/global-citizen-launches-recovery-plan-world-campaign-end-covid-19-all-and-kickstart-global,2021-03-08,Global Citizen,"NEW YORK, Genève, Switzerland | Brussels, Belgium – Tuesday, February 23, 2021 /3BL Media/ – International advocacy organization Global Citizen today launched a Recovery Plan for the World - a campaign to end COVID-19 for all and kickstart a global recovery. The Recovery Plan for the World is a year-long campaign and series of events that aims to: 1) end COVID-19 for all; 2) end the hunger crisis; 3) resume learning everywhere; 4) protect the planet; and 5) advance equity for all.\n“I am incredibly proud of Global Citizen’s efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, but massive inequalities remain and we urgently need to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are made available equitably. Our ‘Recovery Plan for the World’ sets a clear agenda that will inspire millions of citizens to advocate for five of the most critical health, social and economic challenges that currently face humanity, as a result of the pandemic,” said Hugh Evans, Co-Founder and CEO of Global Citizen. “A virus anywhere remains a virus everywhere, and our goal is to unite world leaders, artists and entertainers, philanthropists and CEOs to end COVID-19 for all and kickstart a global recovery.”  \nIn 2020, Global Citizen rallied to help deliver critical financial commitments to fight COVID-19 and led advocacy efforts, which resulted in nearly USD $1.1 billion being disbursed to support the pandemic response. Global Citizen’s efforts centered on the equitable distribution of COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines for everyone everywhere, and the organization’s advocacy also addressed the effect of the pandemic more broadly. Acting as a continuation of the impact achieved through Global Citizen’s One World: Together at Home and Global Goal: Unite for Our Future campaigns, Global Citizen’s efforts in 2021 will focus on the final push to end the pandemic and get the world back on the path to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n“Global Citizen has been a leading force in bringing together civil society and the private sector. We need citizens of the world to mobilise again. We need out of the box thinking and using all means available,” said Ursula von der Leyen, President, European Commission. “This is why I’m proud to support, as President of the European Commission, the new Global Citizen campaign, called ‘Recovery Plan for the World.”\nAs part of Global Citizen’s ‘Recovery Plan for the World’ policy framework, the organization is advocating for commitments from governments, philanthropists and the private sector to: \n\nEnd COVID-19 for All: COVID-19 has threatened the health and economic security of every person around the world. Global Citizen will campaign in support of the ACT-Accelerator, a global partnership launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) to fight COVID-19 through the development and equitable distribution of COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines. More than USD $22 billion is still required to ensure at least two billion vaccines and other COVID-19 medical interventions are available to the poorest countries by the end of 2021. Global Citizen is calling on all wealthy countries to donate excess doses to other countries in need to ensure vaccines are made globally available to everyone, everywhere before vaccine resistant variants begin to emerge and gather pace.\n\n\nEnd the Hunger Crisis: With the pandemic still occurring Global Citizen has not let other issues go unnoticed. With the number of people facing hunger set to double as a direct result of the pandemic, the organization will advocate to ensure good food for all. Global Citizen will call for contributions towards closing the financial gap for programs that work to reduce food waste, support smallholder farmers, and aid in attaining healthier and better school feeding programs for kids of all ages. Global Citizen is advocating for increases in long-term investments to ensure food systems remain resilient and production is not disrupted during the recovery process.\n\n\nResume Learning Everywhere: Children across the global community have been learning remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic and unfortunately many do not have access to the educational tools they need to thrive. At least USD $300 million is needed to support millions of marginalized children's access to quality and inclusive education, school meals, empowerment for girls and children with disabilities, mental and physical health programming, teacher training, technology, remote learning resources and more. Global Citizen is calling on governments, businesses, and philanthropists to increase investment in global education, and ensure resources and action to prioritize the world’s most vulnerable learners, including children that are living through conflict and crisis, girls, and young learners who lack internet access. \n\n\nProtect the Planet: Not a single country is taking sufficient action to stop climate change, while only a quarter of Fortune Global 500 companies have made a public commitment to become carbon neutral, use 100% renewable power, or meet a science-based emission reduction target by 2030. Global Citizen is advocating for additional climate finance, supporting low carbon economies and development, and promoting carbon neutrality, in line with preventing global temperatures from rising beyond 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels. Global Citizen’s advocacy efforts will focus on supporting underserved communities and people living in extreme poverty.\n\n\nAdvance Equity for All: Global Citizen is committed to promoting an equitable and just recovery, including access to COVID-19 vaccinations and medical countermeasures for all. Global Citizen will partner with organizations seeking to address the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 in the United States and worldwide, and will call on world leaders to commit to filling the global justice gap. Global Citizen is calling on the private sector to lean in through transformative commitments to people-centered justice, gender equality, racial equity, inclusion of persons with disabilities, and support for human rights and justice defenders worldwide.\n\nMore information about the policy aims for the campaign can be found in Global Citizen Presents: A Recovery Plan for the World, a white paper that was released today. Download the white paper HERE.\nDr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization, welcomed Global Citizen’s initiative, saying it complemented the U.N. system’s focus for a sustainable recovery to the pandemic, including the WHO Manifesto for a healthy recovery from COVID-19. \n“Since COVID-19 gripped the world, WHO and our partners have been focused on protecting health and saving lives, calling for vaccine equity and following proven public health measures to protect people from the virus,” said Dr. Tedros. “But the impacts of the pandemic go far beyond health and have deeply affected all areas of life, from economies to education. The world must come together to build a durable response to COVID-19 to ensure communities are protected from future emergencies, build resilient systems to withstand shocks, and can reap the benefits of truly sustainable growth.”\nH.E. Cyril Ramaphosa, President of the Republic of South Africa continued, “South Africa is proud to be one of the supporting countries for the five-point Recovery Plan by Global Citizen under the patronage of the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and in partnership with Italy, the G20 Chair. The urgency to get a vaccine to everyone, everywhere cannot be underestimated. As a country we will be joining efforts to help the world recover better by ending the pandemic as a priority, addressing food security and hunger, getting all our children back to school, addressing climate change and protecting the most marginalised. We must ensure that no one is left behind.”  \nLeaders in music and entertainment, including: Billie Eilish, Coldplay, Femi Kuti, H.E.R., Hugh Jackman, Idris & Sabrina Elba, Jonas Brothers, Lang Lang, Lars Ulrich, Miley Cyrus, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Rachel Brosnahan, SuperM, Usher and Yemi Alade have already raised their hands to support the campaign, many of whom are long-time partners of the organization. Global Citizen Ambassadors Jill and Olivia Vedder have also signed on to support the Recovery Plan for the World campaign.  \nWith the support of Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and World Leaders Emmanuel Macron, President of France; Cyril Ramaphosa, President of the Republic of South Africa; Carlos Alvarado Quesada, President of Costa Rica; Nayib Bukele, President of El Salvador; Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of Singapore; Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany; Frank Bainimarama, Prime Minister of Fiji; Erna Solberg, Prime Minister of Norway; Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada; António Costa, Prime Minister of Portugal; Andrej Plenković, Prime Minister of Croatia; Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister of New Zealand; Pedro Sánchez, Prime Minister of Spain; Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic; Robert Abela, Prime Minister of the Republic of Malta; Micheál Martin, Taoiseach of Ireland; Alexander De Croo, Prime Minister of Belgium; as well as H.E. Amina J. Mohammed, Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations; Pedro Brolo Vila, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Guatemala; John Kerry, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate; and the Government of Paraguay. In total, 23 governments and the United Nations have stepped forward to stand in solidarity with the Recovery Plan for the World effort and have also expressed their collective support for the campaign.\n“While COVID-19 has touched every individual on the planet, the pandemic’s impact on the most vulnerable—especially those living in extreme poverty—has been devastating, leaving people worse off than they were, even just a year ago. More than 1.5 billion children have had their education disrupted and millions of families are facing starvation. But the action we take together can make a difference,” said Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Actor, Producer, Author & Global Citizen Ambassador. “By using our voices to call on world leaders, corporations and philanthropists to step up and take urgent action, and by supporting the ‘Recovery Plan for the World’, we can impact millions of lives for the better now, not later. Global Citizen’s plan provides a clear path forward to ensure that we get children back in classrooms, food back on the table for families, and get vaccines, tests and treatments to everyone, everywhere.”\nIn partnership with Declan Kelly and Teneo, the global CEO advisory firm, a coalition of many of the world's leading companies, including: Citi, Cisco, The Coca-Cola Company, Delta Air Lines, Google, Live Nation, P&G and Verizon will work together to engage the private sector to help achieve the Recovery Plan for the World's policy priorities. Co-chairs Chuck Robbins, Chairman and CEO of Cisco; Hans Vestberg, CEO of Verizon; Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines; James Quincey, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company; Marc Pritchard, CBO of P&G; Michael Rapino, CEO of Live Nation; and Jane Fraser, incoming CEO of Citi will lead their respective sectors to step up in-kind and value chain support, and investment for the campaign. Lorraine Twohill, CMO of Google and Mindy Grossman, CEO of WW International will also be supporting leaders of this campaign.  \n“The private sector plays a critical role in ending the COVID-19 pandemic and getting the world back on track to solving some of our most pressing challenges,” said Declan Kelly, Teneo Chairman & CEO and Global Citizen Board Member. “Teneo is incredibly proud to partner with Global Citizen on this historic campaign alongside many CEOs who have also committed to tackling the urgent challenges facing humanity. In addition to our role helping lead the campaign, we are calling on more companies to join our coalition to help end the COVID-19 pandemic, and advance progress and recovery across the globe.”\nRecovery Plan for the World campaign partners, include: The World Health Organization (WHO), The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, The Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, The COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, The Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), UNITAID, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), World Food Programme (WFP), Education Cannot Wait (ECW), Green Climate Fund, Global Access Fund, Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), The Legal Empowerment Network (convened by NAMATI), Outright Action International and The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). \nIn 2021, Global Citizen, in partnership with Teneo, will bring the campaign to life with a series of pledging moments and global events to unite world leaders, artists, philanthropists and CEOs to achieve the campaign’s goals. Key moments, include:\n\nA global broadcast special, airing in May 2021, to overcome vaccine hesitancy and rally governments to equitably distribute COVID-19 vaccines. With the goal of ending the coronavirus pandemic, and in collaboration with the European Commission, the World Health Organization, Italy as the presidency of the G20, the State of California and iHeartMedia, additional details about the May 2021 global broadcast special will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n\nGlobal Citizen LIVE, a multi-hour global event featuring a blockbuster lineup of artists, with performances from all over the world, including: Lagos, New York City, Paris, Seoul and Sydney.

In total, 23 governments and the United Nations have stepped forward to stand in solidarity with the Recovery Plan for the World effort and have also expressed their collective support for the campaign.\n“While COVID-19 has touched every individual on the planet, the pandemic’s impact on the most vulnerable—especially those living in extreme poverty—has been devastating, leaving people worse off than they were, even just a year ago. More than 1.5 billion children have had their education disrupted and millions of families are facing starvation. But the action we take together can make a difference,” said Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Actor, Producer, Author & Global Citizen Ambassador. “By using our voices to call on world leaders, corporations and philanthropists to step up and take urgent action, and by supporting the ‘Recovery Plan for the World’, we can impact millions of lives for the better now, not later. Global Citizen’s plan provides a clear path forward to ensure that we get children back in classrooms, food back on the table for families, and get vaccines, tests and treatments to everyone, everywhere.”\nIn partnership with Declan Kelly and Teneo, the global CEO advisory firm, a coalition of many of the world's leading companies, including: Citi, Cisco, The Coca-Cola Company, Delta Air Lines, Google, Live Nation, P&G and Verizon will work together to engage the private sector to help achieve the Recovery Plan for the World's policy priorities. Co-chairs Chuck Robbins, Chairman and CEO of Cisco; Hans Vestberg, CEO of Verizon; Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines; James Quincey, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company; Marc Pritchard, CBO of P&G; Michael Rapino, CEO of Live Nation; and Jane Fraser, incoming CEO of Citi will lead their respective sectors to step up in-kind and value chain support, and investment for the campaign. Lorraine Twohill, CMO of Google and Mindy Grossman, CEO of WW International will also be supporting leaders of this campaign.  \n“The private sector plays a critical role in ending the COVID-19 pandemic and getting the world back on track to solving some of our most pressing challenges,” said Declan Kelly, Teneo Chairman & CEO and Global Citizen Board Member. “Teneo is incredibly proud to partner with Global Citizen on this historic campaign alongside many CEOs who have also committed to tackling the urgent challenges facing humanity. In addition to our role helping lead the campaign, we are calling on more companies to join our coalition to help end the COVID-19 pandemic, and advance progress and recovery across the globe.”\nRecovery Plan for the World campaign partners, include: The World Health Organization (WHO), The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, The Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, The COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, The Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), UNITAID, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), World Food Programme (WFP), Education Cannot Wait (ECW), Green Climate Fund, Global Access Fund, Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), The Legal Empowerment Network (convened by NAMATI), Outright Action International and The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). \nIn 2021, Global Citizen, in partnership with Teneo, will bring the campaign to life with a series of pledging moments and global events to unite world leaders, artists, philanthropists and CEOs to achieve the campaign’s goals. Key moments, include:\n\nA global broadcast special, airing in May 2021, to overcome vaccine hesitancy and rally governments to equitably distribute COVID-19 vaccines.

What is Global Citizen's ""Recovery Plan for the World"" and what are its goals?

### assistant:'
Global Citizen, an international advocacy group, launched a campaign on February 23, 2021 called ""Recovery Plan for the World"". The campaign's main objective is to end COVID-19 and stimulate global recovery. This year-long campaign and series of events aims to achieve five goals: 1) end COVID-19 for all, 2) end the hunger crisis, 3) resume learning everywhere, 4) protect the planet, and 5) advance equity for all. In 2020, Global Citizen made significant contributions towards fighting COVID-19, securing nearly $1.1 billion to support pandemic response efforts. The organization's 2021 agenda is to continue these efforts with the final push to end the pandemic and help the world achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The announcement was made in New York, Genève, Switzerland and Brussels, Belgium as reported by ThreeBLMedia on March 8, 2021."

The cleanup series was funded by the Tennessee Valley Authority, Tennessee Department of Transportation, Keep America Beautiful and Yamaha Rightwaters™. \nThere were 35,500 lbs. of trash removed at these cleanups, including 903 bags of trash and 136 tires.

River champions in three different geographic regions within the Tennessee River watershed are recognized for their river stewardship.\nTraditionally, the awards are presented at a banquet held before a large river cleanup during Keep the Tennessee River Watershed Beautiful Month.

With #Pledge4Rivers, pledgers can visit www.KeepTNRiverBeautiful.org/pledge4rivers to commit to eliminating one plastic or Styrofoam throwaway item from their daily habits for one year. \nWith 38 people making pledges so far, the totals are already adding up:\nSingle-Use Item         # Pledges                   Items Saved/Year\nPlastic Bottles            14                                2,338 plastic bottles saved / yearStyrofoam Cups         13                                1,066 Styrofoam cups saved / yearPlastic Straws             7                                  4,088 plastic straws saved / yearPlastic Bags                3                                  4,500 plastic bags saved / year11,992 single-use items pledged to be eliminated annually\n“Just looking back at Tennessee’s statewide cleanups over the last year, many of those cleanups were centered around flooding and tornadoes that turned properly disposed trash—much of it single-use items—into litter,” said Kyle Howard of Keep Tennessee Beautiful, who also serves as the KTNRB Board President. \n“When more people start moving toward reusable items, there won’t be an opportunity for this unintentional litter to make its way to our waterways.”\n#Pledge4Rivers is an ongoing campaign and pledges can be made at www.KeepTNRiverBeautiful.org/pledge4rivers.\nPROCLAMATIONS\nEach year, KTNRB seeks proclamations from elected officials to declare October as ‘Keep the Tennessee River Watershed Beautiful Month.’ This year, four governors and four mayors made proclamations:\nTennessee Governor Bill Lee                       Knoxville, TN Mayor Indya KincannonAlabama Governor Kay Ivey                       Lenoir City, TN Mayor Tony AikensMississippi Governor Tate Reeves               Cleveland, TN Mayor Kevin BrooksKentucky Governor Andy Beshear Marion County, TN Mayor David Jackson\n“The Tennessee River is arguably the most valuable natural resource in the Southeast, and we are grateful to these elected officials for taking a leadership role in recognizing its importance,” said Gibi.\nRIPPLE EFFECT AWARDS\nThe 2nd annual Ripple Effect Awards presented by Yamaha Rightwaters™ will be presented digitally this year. River champions in three different geographic regions within the Tennessee River watershed are recognized for their river stewardship.\nTraditionally, the awards are presented at a banquet held before a large river cleanup during Keep the Tennessee River Watershed Beautiful Month. While the highly sought-after glass-blown trophies will still be awarded, they will be presented via professionally edited virtual videos this year. Winners will be announced before the end of the year.\n“We couldn’t be prouder of the work accomplished in our jam-packed Keep the Tennessee River Beautiful Month this year,” said Gibi. “We’re so grateful to our sponsors, partners, and especially the volunteers for making it all possible!”\nFor information on Keep the Tennessee River Beautiful’s ongoing programs or to view their river cleanup schedule, visit www.KeepTNRiverBeautiful.org.\nKeep the Tennessee River Beautiful is the first Keep America Beautiful affiliate in the nation to focus solely on a river. They aim to rally communities along the river to preserve, improve and protect the river for generations to come. To date, more than 1,600 volunteers have helped the organization to remove more than 155,000 lbs. of trash.","### human:

""Microsoft’s position is that the transition has to be an inclusive and just one.""Smaller companies are also using additional social and environmental criteria in procurement decisions. Applied Materials, for example, announced a 100 percent renewable goal by 2022 within the context of its ESG initiatives.The focus on the quality of procurements reflects the maturation of the market, with buyers having options to scrutinize the entirety of clean energy projects, such as impacts on the land, local economy and emissions reduction. Earlier this month, Salesforce released a framework, ""More Than a Megawatt,"" designed to help buyers embed social and environmental benefits into the renewable energy procurement process, hinting at the growing popularity of this lens. Q3 2019 was an impressive quarter for renewable energy transaction disclosures, fueled by New York Climate Week announcements. Of the 10 largest deals of that quarter, seven coincided with Climate Week. Both Google and AT&T announced deals that were multifold larger than what we’d seen in past clean energy trackers. Climate Week 2020 featured corporations going beyond talking up procurements to emphasizing more holistic targets. Major organizations committed to carbon neutrality for direct emissions, including Walmart and AT&T. Morgan Stanley pledged net-zero emissions from its financing activities, and General Electric announced it would exit the market for coal-fired power plants. A handful of organizations signed on to RE100, a commitment to procure the equivalent of a company’s annual electricity consumption from renewables, but these weren’t coupled with a frenzy of PPA announcements. The inclination towards holistic commitments mirrors the emphasis placed on ESG concerns in renewable deals. For the third time in four quarters, some of the most interesting movement in corporate procurements is happening in Europe. These deals, not featured in our U.S. deal tracker, keep getting bigger and more creative. The largest renewable energy PPA to date was inked by oil giant Total — 3.3 GW of solar in Spain, 3 GW of which Total says will power all of its European industrial operations by 2025. This procurement is more than double the previous corporate procurement deal record holder: Google’s 1.6 GW deal, made up of 18 individual projects and announced during Climate Week last year. Total procured 2 GW of solar in February, bringing its procurements to a whopping 5 GW so far in 2020. In the ""innovative models"" category, Swedish utility Vattenfall announced a Dutch ""Corporate PPA Collective"" in which companies of all sizes can buy wind energy directly from Infinergy, a U.K.-based renewables developer. The model essentially allows the utility to act as an aggregating force, allowing small companies to get on the PPA bandwagon without needing to navigate bespoke procurement processes. In a sign of the strength of corporate procurements in Europe, LevelTen, the renewable project marketplace, opened an office in Spain in Q3 with the backing of Total and Equinor. Apple, which recently announced carbon neutrality throughout its operations by 2030, saw its supply chain get a little cleaner in Q3. TSMC, a Taiwan-based semiconductor company that supplies Apple and others, inked what it calls the world’s largest corporate PPA from a single project: 920 MW of offshore wind in Taiwan. The company signed onto RE100 in July, the first semiconductor manufacturer to do so, and urged industry peers to do the same. TSMC’s PPA is also significant because of its locale. Corporate PPAs are new to Asia, and the deal is a harbinger of more commercial and industrial agreements to come. Apple says it is also applying pressure to its suppliers across Europe to move to clean energy, a necessary part to reach carbon neutrality across its manufacturing supply chain.","GreenBiz: 2020-10-21 After a respectable showing of deals in the first and second quarters, the domestic corporate renewable procurement market seems to have cooled slightly — though not dramatically — with U.S. companies inking 1.8 gigawatts of capacity in Q3. The first nine months of 2020 reached 5.8 GW, compared to 7.8 GW at this time in 2019.Anecdotally, I’ve heard whispers that the deals in the pipeline pre-COVID have moved through, and some corporate buyers are waiting for the U.S. presidential election results to strategize their next clean energy move. But international markets are stepping in to pick up whatever slack uncertainty may be creating in the U.S. And while the megawatts capacity has leveled off, the U.S. market is innovating in quality, with more procurements taking a holistic look at benefits. This quarter, several corporate procurement announcements were coupled with broader environmental, social and governance considerations. Microsoft announced its largest single power purchase agreement, 500 MW of solar in collaboration with Sol Systems, which ties the buying of clean energy to environmental justice and equity. ""We spend a lot of time talking about the energy transition needed if our society is going to transition to a net-zero economy by 2050,"" Microsoft’s environmental chief, Lucas Joppa, told GreenBiz’s Heather Clancy about the announcement.

That was early in the game, at 8A, “When tripled, etcetera.”My mind went to math, lighted for a moment on “cubed” (OK, that was way off), then wandered to a visual of a onetime neighbor smartly maneuvering a tight corner, her newborn triplets arrayed one behind another in a stroller as long as an S.U.V.Yes, the clue is directing us to multiply by three, and when you triple the answer, YADDA, you get “Seinfeld.”Another answer that did not come readily to mind was 62A, “President who finished third in his race for re-election.” Now that is an epic fail. I’m sure Ralph Nader and Jill Stein are used to making a bold stand and raking in only a handful of chips, but William Howard TAFT was an incumbent when he came in third. He made a memorable comeback, however, as chief justice of the Supreme Court.When I reached 22A, “Clean with elbow grease,” I mistakenly put in “scrub,” but that only lasted until 4D, “Honor musically,” became a muddled mess.

The Tuesday puzzle from TheNewYorkTimes dated 2020-10-06 has a quirky theme. The creators, veteran constructor Andrea Carla Michaels and her collaborator, Alan Massengill, played around with everyday expressions by punning on their consonants. Their wordplay involved adding the letter ""F"" to the front of four expressions that began with ""R,"" changing their meanings and turning them into amusing phrases.

For example, Seth Klarman, founder of the hedge fund Baupost who was once a big donor to the Republican Party, has given $3 million to groups supporting Mr. Biden in this cycle.• Financiers are closely watching Mr. Biden’s pick for his running mate. Their support could wane if he chooses Elizabeth Warren, who has proposed a wealth tax and much tougher financial regulation than Mr. Biden.In Silicon Valley, the tech giants are also making overtures. The Times’s David McCabe and Kenneth Vogel report that Mr. Biden’s campaign has welcomed staff members and advisers who have ties to Big Tech, “raising concerns among the industry’s critics that the companies are seeking to co-opt a potential Biden administration.”• The Innovation Policy Committee, a nearly 700-person volunteer group advising the Biden campaign, includes at least eight people who work for Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, in addition to economists and lawyers who have advised those companies, and officials from think tanks funded by them.

The mogul, Jimmy Lai, is an outspoken critic of Beijing and was detained today on charges of violating Hong Kong’s new national security law. The law’s role in suppressing the territory’s pro-democracy movement was the motivation for the U.S. in imposing financial sanctions on a range of Chinese officials on Friday, including Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam. China announced today that it would impose unspecified sanctions on 11 U.S. citizens, including Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, in a tit-for-tat escalation.President Trump’s executive actions are causing confusion. The stimulus measures, signed on Saturday, attempt to sidestep a gridlocked Congress with edicts of dubious legality. What’s more, the proposals — extending supplemental unemployment benefits, suspending some payroll taxes, suggesting an eviction ban and offering student loan relief — are unlikely to deliver cash quickly to support the economic recovery. Of the measures, the student loan relief seems the least controversial and easiest to carry out.Amazon is reportedly considering turning bankrupt department stores into fulfillment centers.

Here, she details the ins and outs of an increasingly bitter takeover battle. You can follow her on Twitter at @footnoted.Unsolicited takeover proposals can be complicated and expensive, even in the absence of a pandemic. Since the beginning of summer, CoreLogic, a real estate data analytics firm, has been waging war with the Las Vegas-based investment company Cannae Holdings and Senator Investment Group, a New York-based hedge fund, over interest from Cannae and Senator in acquiring CoreLogic for $7 billion, including debt.On Friday, things got messier, with CoreLogic disclosing that it had received a civil investigative demand and a subpoena from the Federal Trade Commission seeking details about the proposed acquisition, which CoreLogic has consistently rejected. The disclosure implies that the F.T.C. is ratcheting up its investigation of the deal. On July 15, CoreLogic, based in Irvine, Calif., disclosed in a filing that it had received “written notification” from the F.T.C. seeking information about the approach.Cannae, which is publicly traded, reported second-quarter earnings on Friday but never mentioned a subpoena or investigation by the F.T.C. in either the earnings release or in an accompanying conference call. While there’s no rule mandating that a company disclose a subpoena to investors, it’s fairly common for companies to acknowledge that sort of thing in a filing. Companies have four business days after a significant event to reveal important developments, so Cannae might still choose to disclose this, particularly now that CoreLogic has done it for them.The fight dates back to late June, when Cannae and Senator sent the unsolicited proposal to buy CoreLogic for $65 a share. (At the time, CoreLogic was trading at around $53 a share.) In the letter, Cannae and Senator said they owned about 15 percent of CoreLogic’s shares. CoreLogic formally rejected the proposal as too low on July 7. The three companies met a week later, and shortly thereafter, CoreLogic issued a statement rejecting a request for private due diligence by the bidders. On July 29, Cannae and Senator upped the ante by calling for a special meeting and proposed nine new directors for CoreLogic’s 12-person board, criticizing what they called the company’s “scorched earth” tactics in rejecting their approach. (In 2012, CoreLogic settled a spat with the hedge fund Highfields Capital Management by appointing a handful of new directors.)Yesterday, CoreLogic called a special meeting for Nov. 17 for investors to vote on the directors proposed by Cannae and Senator, “in order to remove uncertainty” over the “convoluted” takeover proposal. The plot thickens.Corporate leaders have been pledging support for civil rights initiatives and re-examining their records on racial inequality, but critics contend that well-intentioned promises have had little effect. On our latest DealBook Debrief call, Nikole Hannah-Jones, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The Times Magazine and creator of the 1619 Project, said that “corporate America has a much, much larger role to play.” If you missed the call, listen to a recording here. Some of the highlights:• “How are corporations using the power that they have in Congress?”Although hiring and promotion practices are important, “I’m thinking much, much bigger than, ‘Can we raise our Black staff from 6 percent to 10 percent?’ ” Nikole said, adding, “That’s very minimal if we’re talking about a moment of reckoning.” Companies can use their political heft to address “much bigger societal issues” like education, she noted. A push for integrating and improving public schools would have broad community benefits, including when it comes to hiring. “A lot of times you look at what companies are saying, and then you look at what candidates and issues they’re supporting, and there’s a deep incongruence there, if not hypocrisy,” she said.• “A meritocracy is not built on continuing to advance and advantage the same people who have already had every advantage.”When recruiting, companies tend to stick too rigidly to requirements on education and experience that ignore structural inequalities, Nikole said. “We need the person who is Black, but also has the exact same résumé and criteria as the white person, despite the fact that we know there’s a great deal of structural inequality,” she said, describing a common thought process among corporate recruiters. “The typical Black child attends a high-poverty, underresourced school,” she noted, and “they’re not going to have the same internships, they’re not going to have the same letters of reference. But that kid has worked really hard, and that kid is going to come into your institution with certain skills and knowledge and fight.”• “Maybe they can just wait this moment out.”Is there a risk for companies to not take action during the national uproar about racial inequality? The “cynical way of thinking about it,” Nikole said, is that “our country’s attention to racial injustice is very fleeting.” Public pressure on companies will determine whether they act or not. “In the end, I don’t think not doing anything has ever been that risky,” she said, “except for these kind of key moments — the end of the civil rights movement for one, and perhaps now — but that’s likely going to depend on us.”Deals• Are megadeals back?

A push for integrating and improving public schools would have broad community benefits, including when it comes to hiring. “A lot of times you look at what companies are saying, and then you look at what candidates and issues they’re supporting, and there’s a deep incongruence there, if not hypocrisy,” she said.• “A meritocracy is not built on continuing to advance and advantage the same people who have already had every advantage.”When recruiting, companies tend to stick too rigidly to requirements on education and experience that ignore structural inequalities, Nikole said. “We need the person who is Black, but also has the exact same résumé and criteria as the white person, despite the fact that we know there’s a great deal of structural inequality,” she said, describing a common thought process among corporate recruiters. “The typical Black child attends a high-poverty, underresourced school,” she noted, and “they’re not going to have the same internships, they’re not going to have the same letters of reference. But that kid has worked really hard, and that kid is going to come into your institution with certain skills and knowledge and fight.”• “Maybe they can just wait this moment out.”Is there a risk for companies to not take action during the national uproar about racial inequality? The “cynical way of thinking about it,” Nikole said, is that “our country’s attention to racial injustice is very fleeting.” Public pressure on companies will determine whether they act or not. “In the end, I don’t think not doing anything has ever been that risky,” she said, “except for these kind of key moments — the end of the civil rights movement for one, and perhaps now — but that’s likely going to depend on us.”Deals• Are megadeals back?

What is the future impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on power consumption and climate concerns?
### assistant:;
The World Economic Forum suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) could play a significant role in saving the planet, as it is integral to a range of technologies related to energy efficiency and climate crisis solutions. However, application of AI also comes with ethical, power consumption and electronic waste concerns. The process of training neural networks is energy-intensive, consuming five times the lifetime emissions of the average U.S. car. Furthermore, given the current rate of AI adoption with no changes in server hardware and software, data centers could claim 15 percent of the world's power load, according to Gary Dickerson, CEO of Applied Materials. Various tech companies though are exploring advances such as ""die stacking"" in computing hardware design, MRAM (magnetic random-access memory), carbon-free cloud data centers, and using specialized AI-savvy processors in gadgets or systems for localized processing to balance AI's benefits and environmental impacts. It was mentioned that the environmental implications of these system overhauls should be included in data center procurement criteria. The article is from GreenBiz on the 29th of July, 2020."

61c9550c857b5f40e0799be1,GreenBiz,Health and Safety,Remembering Flex exec Bruce Klafter,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/remembering-flex-exec-bruce-klafter,2020-07-26,Pete May,"Longtime GreenBiz friend Bruce Klafter died July 18 after a short and intense bout of pancreatic cancer. Bruce most recently was a vice president of sustainability strategy and outreach at Flex in Silicon Valley. GreenBiz co-founder and President Pete May reflects on his interaction with Bruce over the years. And below, we provide memories of Bruce from many of his friends and collaborators in the sustainability community.In the course of a business career, you meet colleagues who are smart, or kind, or just really good at what they do. Bruce Klafter was all of those things. I first met Bruce in 2007. Joel Makower and I had just founded GreenBiz Group (then called Greener World Media). I was very actively getting out to meet practitioners in what was then the emerging field of sustainable business. Bruce at that time was managing director, corporate responsibility and sustainability at Applied Materials — then and now a massive player in materials engineering for the semiconductor and solar photovoltaic industries.Bruce was engaging, warm, thoughtful and way farther along the journey in sustainability and environmental, health and safety issues than most people I spoke with back then. (Read his 2013 interview, when he ""retired"" from Applied Materials, in which he recounts his professional journey to that point.)Over the years, I got to know Bruce and I considered him a friend. We even got together to play tennis once and he roundly thrashed me. He was in good shape but, more tellingly, he was strategic in how he played — just as he was in his day job. In typical Bruce fashion, he offered no trash-talking after; he instead commended me on my game and noted what I needed to work on. Bruce was always a big fan of GreenBiz — our website, our team and our events. He was always diplomatic but he didn’t shrink from giving detailed, measured and constructive feedback. I can still hear him, with his Chicago accent, saying, ""Yeah, that article on LCA was good, but I think you could have gone deeper on ..."" Or ""I thought the conference was good this year, and your team always does a professional job, but I thought the mainstage speakers could have been better.""Or without arrogance, ""I thought some of the sessions were too 101.""Feedback from Bruce was always valuable, never trite, never superficial and never a stroke to one’s ego. I always walked away thinking ""Yeah, we can really improve in this or that area.""Engaging with and giving back to the community always came easily for Bruce. He was present at most every sustainability gathering in the San Francisco Bay Area and often farther afield — as a speaker or just an attendee. He lectured at the Presidio School of Management and was integrally involved with Acterra, SASB, GRI and other sustainability leadership organizations. Bruce was present at leading conferences such as GreenBiz, VERGE and BSR. He always had time for early career professionals who sought his advice. In 2013, Bruce joined Flex, the giant multinational electronics contract manufacturer, where he most recently was vice president of sustainability strategy and outreach.Over the years, we would meet up regularly at Flex headquarters in San Jose, where Bruce would share insights about the company and the industry. When I saw him in January, we spent some time in the cafeteria. We talked about work and he gave me advice on how GreenBiz should deal with Flex. When I asked him about his family, he lit up, speaking so proudly of his kids. By that time Bruce was dealing with a challenge way bigger than any challenge in his career: pancreatic cancer. And he was doing it with courage, in his own quiet measured way, Bruce attended our GreenBiz 20 in Phoenix in February. He later confided in me that that was where the cancer treatments really started to affect him.I last saw him at our VERGE Host Committee meeting at Cisco Systems in late February, just weeks before the world shut down for COVID-19. He participated actively, passionately describing Flex’s work in the circular economy and other topics. During a break, he expressed a quiet confidence in how he was dealing with his illness. From the calm way he described it, I never imagined that was the last time I would see him. But it was. And that hurts. On July 21, his family held a beautiful and moving ceremony. With more than 200 friends and colleagues tuning in by Zoom, the officiating rabbi, along with Bruce’s spouse, son and daughter, described a caring father and husband known for his humble, caring and unassuming manner. Cancer is cruel. It often takes the best among us. Like Bruce Klafter. Bruce, you were loved and will be sorely missed by the team at GreenBiz Group, and by the sustainability community all around us.  The Klafter family has requested that any donations in his name go to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, dedicated to fighting the world’s toughest cancer.Below are a handful of memories from members of the sustainability community who Bruce touched.Deepest condolences to Bruce's family.

Bruce most recently was a vice president of sustainability strategy and outreach at Flex in Silicon Valley. GreenBiz co-founder and President Pete May reflects on his interaction with Bruce over the years. And below, we provide memories of Bruce from many of his friends and collaborators in the sustainability community.In the course of a business career, you meet colleagues who are smart, or kind, or just really good at what they do. Bruce Klafter was all of those things. I first met Bruce in 2007. Joel Makower and I had just founded GreenBiz Group (then called Greener World Media). I was very actively getting out to meet practitioners in what was then the emerging field of sustainable business. Bruce at that time was managing director, corporate responsibility and sustainability at Applied Materials — then and now a massive player in materials engineering for the semiconductor and solar photovoltaic industries.Bruce was engaging, warm, thoughtful and way farther along the journey in sustainability and environmental, health and safety issues than most people I spoke with back then. (Read his 2013 interview, when he ""retired"" from Applied Materials, in which he recounts his professional journey to that point.)Over the years, I got to know Bruce and I considered him a friend. We even got together to play tennis once and he roundly thrashed me. He was in good shape but, more tellingly, he was strategic in how he played — just as he was in his day job. In typical Bruce fashion, he offered no trash-talking after; he instead commended me on my game and noted what I needed to work on. Bruce was always a big fan of GreenBiz — our website, our team and our events. He was always diplomatic but he didn’t shrink from giving detailed, measured and constructive feedback. I can still hear him, with his Chicago accent, saying, ""Yeah, that article on LCA was good, but I think you could have gone deeper on ..."" Or ""I thought the conference was good this year, and your team always does a professional job, but I thought the mainstage speakers could have been better.""Or without arrogance, ""I thought some of the sessions were too 101.""Feedback from Bruce was always valuable, never trite, never superficial and never a stroke to one’s ego. I always walked away thinking ""Yeah, we can really improve in this or that area.""Engaging with and giving back to the community always came easily for Bruce. He was present at most every sustainability gathering in the San Francisco Bay Area and often farther afield — as a speaker or just an attendee. He lectured at the Presidio School of Management and was integrally involved with Acterra, SASB, GRI and other sustainability leadership organizations. Bruce was present at leading conferences such as GreenBiz, VERGE and BSR. He always had time for early career professionals who sought his advice. In 2013, Bruce joined Flex, the giant multinational electronics contract manufacturer, where he most recently was vice president of sustainability strategy and outreach.Over the years, we would meet up regularly at Flex headquarters in San Jose, where Bruce would share insights about the company and the industry. When I saw him in January, we spent some time in the cafeteria. We talked about work and he gave me advice on how GreenBiz should deal with Flex. When I asked him about his family, he lit up, speaking so proudly of his kids. By that time Bruce was dealing with a challenge way bigger than any challenge in his career: pancreatic cancer. And he was doing it with courage, in his own quiet measured way, Bruce attended our GreenBiz 20 in Phoenix in February. He later confided in me that that was where the cancer treatments really started to affect him.I last saw him at our VERGE Host Committee meeting at Cisco Systems in late February, just weeks before the world shut down for COVID-19. He participated actively, passionately describing Flex’s work in the circular economy and other topics. During a break, he expressed a quiet confidence in how he was dealing with his illness. From the calm way he described it, I never imagined that was the last time I would see him. But it was. And that hurts. On July 21, his family held a beautiful and moving ceremony. With more than 200 friends and colleagues tuning in by Zoom, the officiating rabbi, along with Bruce’s spouse, son and daughter, described a caring father and husband known for his humble, caring and unassuming manner. Cancer is cruel. It often takes the best among us. Like Bruce Klafter. Bruce, you were loved and will be sorely missed by the team at GreenBiz Group, and by the sustainability community all around us.  The Klafter family has requested that any donations in his name go to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, dedicated to fighting the world’s toughest cancer.Below are a handful of memories from members of the sustainability community who Bruce touched.Deepest condolences to Bruce's family.

Who was Bruce Klafter and what happened to him?

### assistant:;
Bruce Klafter was a longtime friend of GreenBiz and an influential figure in the field of sustainability strategy. He has held significant positions in companies such as Flex, where he was most recently a vice president of sustainability strategy and outreach, and Applied Materials, where he served as the managing director of corporate responsibility and sustainability. Klafter was known for his engaging, warm, and thoughtful nature, his deep understanding of sustainability and environmental issues, and his dedication to various sustainability leadership organizations. Sadly, he passed away on July 18, 2020, after a brief yet intense battle with pancreatic cancer (GreenBiz, 2020-07-26)."
61c9498d857b5f40e079684a,GreenBiz,Packaging Material and Waste,"What makes Al Gore hopeful: Tech innovation, science-based targets and the racial 'awakening'",https://www.greenbiz.com/article/what-makes-al-gore-hopeful-tech-innovation-science-based-targets-and-racial-awakening,2020-07-21,Heather Clancy,"Who is responsible for emissions? Where did they originate? How can we be sure? A global coalition fronted by former Vice President Al Gore promises granular insights and data into those sources — down to individual power plants, ships or factories.Climate TRACE (short for Tracking Real-time Atmospheric Carbon Emissions) intends to use a massive worldwide network of satellite images, land- and sea-based sensors and advanced artificial intelligence to generate what it’s describing as the ""most thorough and reliable data on emissions the world has ever seen.""The long lag it takes to calculate this information today is untenable if countries and the corporate sector hope to act quickly, the group wrote in a blog about the initiative, co-authored by Gore and Gavin McCormick, founder and executive director of coalition member WattTime.""From companies looking to select cleaner manufacturing suppliers, to investors seeking to divest from polluting industries, to consumers making choices about which businesses to patronize, one thing is clear: a reliable way to measure where emissions are coming from is necessary,"" they wrote. ""Climate TRACE will empower all of these actors."" Climate TRACE is just the latest example of the former vice president’s decades-long commitment to educating the world about the climate crisis, through The Climate Reality Project, and to investing in technologies and solutions that could address it, through Generation Investment Manager. Emissions monitoring using advanced technologies is something all members of the coalition have been working on for some time, but breakthroughs in software and processing technologies — as well as the will to take action more quickly than mid-decade — prompted the coalition members to step forward with the goal of making its first report before the United Nations COP26 conference in 2021.Candidly, Gore is the reason I’m on the corporate climate beat, so I was inspired by the invitation to interview him as a virtual keynote session for SEMICON West, a conference focused on members of the semiconductor industry.""There are real indications that this COVID-19 pandemic has actually accelerated the shift toward more sustainable technologies and as much as anything else, I would say there has been a very dramatic change in attitudes,"" Gore told me at the beginning of our chat, prerecorded before the Climate TRACE announcement. To be clear, the data isn’t encouraging. As Gore related during our conversation, 19 of the 20 hottest years ""ever measured with instruments"" have been in the last 20 years — and 2020 is on pace to dethrone the current record holder for hottest year on record. What’s more, Gore observes that we’re still emitting 152 million tons of heat-trapping pollution into the atmosphere every 24 hours.The consequences of that imbalance are felt in water cycle disruptions, sea-level rises, far stronger storms and the spread of tropical diseases northward, he noted. ""It’s a real horror story and since our civilization has been built up almost entirely during this climate envelope, if you will, that has persisted since the end of the last ice age, the fact that we’re changing those conditions so radically poses an existential threat to the survival of human civilization as we know it.""But advances in processing, communications and data analysis technologies give Gore hope that humans still can take meaningful action, especially with new resolve and urgency borne out of the COVID-19 crisis, Gore told me. ""This can be the stimulus we need for sustainable prosperity in the wake of the pandemic as we finally come out of it, so it’s so important that this tremendous industry has awakened to this challenge and is providing tremendous leadership,"" he said.  Following is a partial transcript of our conversation, which picks up after Gore’s opening remarks. The comments were edited for clarity and length. Heather Clancy: Do you see any long-term changes emanating from the COVD-19 crisis that could help the world deliver a zero-carbon future? Are there nuggets of hope in the response that you can point to specifically?Gore:  Well, you have to go country by country, and I don’t want to dwell too much on the response here in the United States right now. I’m a recovering politician, and I don’t want to stray back into that field. The longer I go without a relapse, the less likely one becomes. But you can find examples of hope and optimism in many country’s response to the pandemic and their success should be emulated elsewhere. I’ll leave it at that.But there are many realizations that are coming from this. We now know that the burning of fossil fuels is a precondition for higher mortality rates under COVID-19. There was a study of 324 cities in China showing a linear correlation between the infection rate and the death rate from COVID-19 compared to the amount of fossil fuels burned in those locations.A Harvard study showed the same thing here in the U.S. and even if you go back to the 1918-1919 [flu] pandemic, there was a very thorough study just 18 months ago showing that the amount of coal burned in cities throughout the U.S., again, was correlated precisely with the death rate from the great flu pandemic a little over 100 years ago.Now we’ve already also seen with COVID-19 a rapid reduction in travel and an increase in working from home and I’m sure many of the people listening to us, Heather, have had the same experience I know you and I have had. That is thinking, ""Wow, this stuff works pretty well. Maybe we don’t have to make all of those airplane flights that we have been chained to for all this time,’"" and there are many other examples.There are real indications that this COVID-19 pandemic has actually accelerated the shift toward more sustainable technologies and as much as anything else, I would say there has been a very dramatic change in attitudes. I don’t want to sound Pollyannish, but I really believe there has been a kind of a general awakening. The gains from the LGBTQ community of the last several years are being consolidated. The gains demanded in gender equity over the last several years are also being consolidated, and I think, again, the shocking new awareness on the part of so many of the inequities and injustices that communities of color have been experiencing for a lot of reasons. I mean, they are much more likely to be downwind from the smokestacks and downstream from the hazardous waste flows, but they also have much less access to quality healthcare.Their housing, by and large, is not the same. They don’t have the Zoom-able jobs like we do right now on average. Incomes, I mean, it takes 11.5 typical Black families, average Black families to make up the net worth of one white family, average white family in the U.S. and these statistics have remained unchanged for 50 years. We’ve got to change that, and I think there is a general increase in awareness, an awakening if you will.One jokester called it The Great Awokening. I don’t think I’ll use that phrase as my own, but I do think there is something to it. I think that the rising generation is demanding a better future, and if they knew all that you have planned and underway in this industry, they would feel so good about it. I’m going to do my part to make sure they do find out about it.Clancy: What foundational technologies do you see coming out of this moment of destruction that could really make an impact? And let’s go to the semiconductor industry. What positive developments do you see happening where they could really make a difference?Gore: Some of the innovation around new materials has been particularly impressive to me, materials like silicon carbide … These have been already essential in, well, take increasing the range of Tesla’s electric vehicles and actually that’s another mark of the change. Tesla just became the most valuable automobile company in the world, surpassing Toyota. That’s pretty impressive. I’ll mention one more: Innovations around how semiconductors are packaged, that’s also been a prominent trend and essential in enabling the next generation of algorithms which power things like drug discovery, which has got our attention right now, and smart electricity grids which are much more power efficient.Clancy: What could get in the way of these advances? What concerns should the industry have from an environmental standpoint as they take these to the mainstream?Gore: Well, we are seeing a challenge to the efficacy of self-government. I don’t want to sound too highfalutin on this, but really here in the U.S., we have seen what can stand in our way when we pretty much know what to do and we just have to get our act together and think and act collectively to do it and when we let partisanship get out of bounds and when we don’t accept the authority of knowledge, when we tolerate an assault on reason and when we allow powerful players in the economy to embark on information strategies that are intended to put out wrong facts.I started to say alternative facts but, again, I don’t want to trip over all of those controversies. But it is a problem, seriously, and we have seen that spread to some other countries like Brazil and the Philippines and Hungary, not to mention Russia. Democracy itself is the most efficient way of making collective decisions because it allows us to harvest the wisdom of crowds.There is a lot of scholarship on how diversity in crowds, if it’s properly appreciated and tapped into, can make any group and any company way smarter than the smartest person in that company. So I do believe that we are seeing a number of positive developments, and I do have a lot of confidence in this rising generation that is insisting that we get on with these solutions.Clancy: You referenced data centers and cloud computing services earlier, particularly for enabling things like artificial intelligence — which we need for drug discovery, we need for so many things, so many applications related to conservation and climate change. But these things use a lot of electricity. How can the tech industry address this?Gore: New technologies, innovation efficiency — including some of the new developments that I’ve already mentioned — will help, but we’ve got to go into this with our eyes wide open. Applied Materials has told us that, has told the world that their studies indicate that we could actually see a very large increase in the amount of energy used for information processing and that makes this challenge even more urgent.But I do continue to be optimistic, very optimistic on the ability of this industry to rise to the challenge and there are some things the industry could do, and I know some of these have been discussed. First of all, collaborate across the industry from semiconductor equipment makers to software companies with academia to think about how to deliver a step change in the efficiency of data center semiconductors.It’s been encouraging already to see cutting-edge applications of artificial intelligence to effectively reduce data server energy use by significant amounts without any changes to hardware. I’ve been following for a few years now Google’s use of its DeepMind Division to dramatically reduce energy use in server farms, again, without any new hardware. That’s awfully impressive… Now they had the advantage of a lot of structured data to work with. They’re Google, after all, so they got a lot of structured data but there are thousands of use cases where that same approach can also be used. Secondly, reduce the electricity required to manufacture semiconductors. I’ve been amazed at the increasing amount of power required to manufacture these ever-smaller chips, and I would join with others in encouraging all of the equipment manufacturers to work together to reduce carbon emissions in the manufacturing of these advanced semiconductors and finally continue decarbonizing the power supply on which the data centers operate…Clancy: I want to go back to something you referenced in your opening remarks, which is the environmental justice issue. It’s well-documented that climate change has a disproportionate impact on communities of color. How can the tech industry act internally and externally to change this to get rid of that digital divide that prevents progress?Gore: Well, I think first of all, this awakening that I talked about has affected people in the semiconductor industry. You look at these protest marches around the U.S. The vast majority of those marching are white and two-thirds of the American people now say they support the Black Lives Matter movement, a dramatic change compared to just two months ago.And, of course, George Floyd’s murder was a turning point but it’s also reflective of the changes that we have seen more broadly in our society. I mentioned already the fact that the communities of color are suffering disproportionately from COVID-19, and there are many reasons for it.But it’s wise for every industry, particularly a cutting-edge industry like this one, to respond very effectively to the rising demands from two groups. First, younger employees who want their work to have meaning. Many of the executives listening to us have already long since learned that when they interview the best and brightest to join their firms, they find that the job applicants are interviewing them. They want to know whether or not the company shares their views on sustainability and shares their views on diversity.And, by the way, I mentioned the wisdom of crowds earlier. I don’t want to emphasize it too much, but we’ve studied that a lot at Generation, and the scholars tell us and the evidence proves that you benefit tremendously in your collective thinking from as much diversity as possible on every matrix except one. You don’t want any diversity on values. But then if you have different life experiences, different points of view, different religious traditions, different ethnicities and all of the rest orientations, that adds to the ability of any company to make better collective decisions. And so for the tech industry, specifically, it’s long been known that this industry has work to do in order to deal with the struggle to become more racially and culturally diverse.We’ve seen software companies make some very encouraging efforts to broaden their hiring funnels through apprenticeships and scholarships, but that could probably be increased in the semiconductor industry also.Clancy: Speed is of the essence in the fight against the climate crisis. How can the tech industry and the government work together maybe like in the area of research and development but also more broadly to make the most of this moment?Gore: Well, I think that the Science Based Targets initiative is a particularly important initiative that can make a tremendous difference, and I want to commend the leaders in this industry who have taken that step. I want to encourage others to adopt and embrace a science-based target to make sure that their activities and their emissions reductions plans are in keeping with what the global scientific community, the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] says is necessary to stay below a 1.5-degree Celsius increase in temperatures.Look, this is an existential threat to our society, and I know I’ve used that phrase, but we’ve got to accept that and we have got to take leadership and make sure that we’re doing everything we can. It’s just unbearable to imagine a future generation living with the kinds of consequences the scientists tell us would ensue if we don’t solve this crisis.And imagine them looking back at us in the year 2020 and asking, ""Why in the hell didn’t you do something about it? Didn’t you hear the scientists? Couldn’t you hear Mother Nature screaming at you?"" Every night on the TV news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation, practically. We’re appropriately focused on the pandemic now, but even now we’re seeing these extreme weather events and the increasingly dire forecasts from the scientists. So I’m encouraged by this industry, and I think that the science-based targets approach is a really great step, and I’d encourage everybody to adopt them.","GreenBiz: 2020-07-21 Who is responsible for emissions? Where did they originate? How can we be sure?

I don’t want to sound too highfalutin on this, but really here in the U.S., we have seen what can stand in our way when we pretty much know what to do and we just have to get our act together and think and act collectively to do it and when we let partisanship get out of bounds and when we don’t accept the authority of knowledge, when we tolerate an assault on reason and when we allow powerful players in the economy to embark on information strategies that are intended to put out wrong facts.I started to say alternative facts but, again, I don’t want to trip over all of those controversies. But it is a problem, seriously, and we have seen that spread to some other countries like Brazil and the Philippines and Hungary, not to mention Russia. Democracy itself is the most efficient way of making collective decisions because it allows us to harvest the wisdom of crowds.There is a lot of scholarship on how diversity in crowds, if it’s properly appreciated and tapped into, can make any group and any company way smarter than the smartest person in that company. So I do believe that we are seeing a number of positive developments, and I do have a lot of confidence in this rising generation that is insisting that we get on with these solutions.Clancy: You referenced data centers and cloud computing services earlier, particularly for enabling things like artificial intelligence — which we need for drug discovery, we need for so many things, so many applications related to conservation and climate change. But these things use a lot of electricity. How can the tech industry address this?Gore: New technologies, innovation efficiency — including some of the new developments that I’ve already mentioned — will help, but we’ve got to go into this with our eyes wide open. Applied Materials has told us that, has told the world that their studies indicate that we could actually see a very large increase in the amount of energy used for information processing and that makes this challenge even more urgent.But I do continue to be optimistic, very optimistic on the ability of this industry to rise to the challenge and there are some things the industry could do, and I know some of these have been discussed. First of all, collaborate across the industry from semiconductor equipment makers to software companies with academia to think about how to deliver a step change in the efficiency of data center semiconductors.It’s been encouraging already to see cutting-edge applications of artificial intelligence to effectively reduce data server energy use by significant amounts without any changes to hardware. I’ve been following for a few years now Google’s use of its DeepMind Division to dramatically reduce energy use in server farms, again, without any new hardware. That’s awfully impressive… Now they had the advantage of a lot of structured data to work with. They’re Google, after all, so they got a lot of structured data but there are thousands of use cases where that same approach can also be used. Secondly, reduce the electricity required to manufacture semiconductors. I’ve been amazed at the increasing amount of power required to manufacture these ever-smaller chips, and I would join with others in encouraging all of the equipment manufacturers to work together to reduce carbon emissions in the manufacturing of these advanced semiconductors and finally continue decarbonizing the power supply on which the data centers operate…Clancy: I want to go back to something you referenced in your opening remarks, which is the environmental justice issue. It’s well-documented that climate change has a disproportionate impact on communities of color. How can the tech industry act internally and externally to change this to get rid of that digital divide that prevents progress?Gore: Well, I think first of all, this awakening that I talked about has affected people in the semiconductor industry. You look at these protest marches around the U.S. The vast majority of those marching are white and two-thirds of the American people now say they support the Black Lives Matter movement, a dramatic change compared to just two months ago.And, of course, George Floyd’s murder was a turning point but it’s also reflective of the changes that we have seen more broadly in our society. I mentioned already the fact that the communities of color are suffering disproportionately from COVID-19, and there are many reasons for it.But it’s wise for every industry, particularly a cutting-edge industry like this one, to respond very effectively to the rising demands from two groups. First, younger employees who want their work to have meaning. Many of the executives listening to us have already long since learned that when they interview the best and brightest to join their firms, they find that the job applicants are interviewing them. They want to know whether or not the company shares their views on sustainability and shares their views on diversity.And, by the way, I mentioned the wisdom of crowds earlier. I don’t want to emphasize it too much, but we’ve studied that a lot at Generation, and the scholars tell us and the evidence proves that you benefit tremendously in your collective thinking from as much diversity as possible on every matrix except one. You don’t want any diversity on values. But then if you have different life experiences, different points of view, different religious traditions, different ethnicities and all of the rest orientations, that adds to the ability of any company to make better collective decisions. And so for the tech industry, specifically, it’s long been known that this industry has work to do in order to deal with the struggle to become more racially and culturally diverse.We’ve seen software companies make some very encouraging efforts to broaden their hiring funnels through apprenticeships and scholarships, but that could probably be increased in the semiconductor industry also.Clancy: Speed is of the essence in the fight against the climate crisis. How can the tech industry and the government work together maybe like in the area of research and development but also more broadly to make the most of this moment?Gore: Well, I think that the Science Based Targets initiative is a particularly important initiative that can make a tremendous difference, and I want to commend the leaders in this industry who have taken that step. I want to encourage others to adopt and embrace a science-based target to make sure that their activities and their emissions reductions plans are in keeping with what the global scientific community, the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] says is necessary to stay below a 1.5-degree Celsius increase in temperatures.Look, this is an existential threat to our society, and I know I’ve used that phrase, but we’ve got to accept that and we have got to take leadership and make sure that we’re doing everything we can. It’s just unbearable to imagine a future generation living with the kinds of consequences the scientists tell us would ensue if we don’t solve this crisis.And imagine them looking back at us in the year 2020 and asking, ""Why in the hell didn’t you do something about it? Didn’t you hear the scientists? Couldn’t you hear Mother Nature screaming at you?"" Every night on the TV news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation, practically. We’re appropriately focused on the pandemic now, but even now we’re seeing these extreme weather events and the increasingly dire forecasts from the scientists. So I’m encouraged by this industry, and I think that the science-based targets approach is a really great step, and I’d encourage everybody to adopt them.","### human: 
What is the Climate TRACE initiative and who are the major stakeholders involved?
### assistant:The Climate TRACE (Tracking Real-time Atmospheric Carbon Emissions) initiative aims to provide granular insights and data into emission sources. The initiative plans to use a massive global network of satellite images, land and sea-based sensors, and advanced artificial intelligence to deliver accurate and comprehensive data on emissions. This is led by a global coalition which includes former Vice President Al Gore, and it is primarily for the purpose of hastening action on climate change. WattTime, overseen by founder and executive director Gavin McCormick, is a coalition member involved in the initiative. The group aims to release its first report prior to the United Nations’ COP26 conference in 2021. This information was reported by GreenBiz on July 21, 2020.
   
### human: 
What is the relevance of new processing, communications, and data analysis technologies to the climate crisis, according to Al Gore?
### assistant:The new processing, communications, and data analysis technologies give Al Gore hope that humans can still take meaningful action against the climate crisis. Al Gore said that the resolve and urgency borne out of the COVID-19 crisis is especially important for taking meaningful action, which can be the stimulus needed for sustainable prosperity once the pandemic is over. He expressed this in a virtual keynote session for SEMICON West, a conference focused on members of the semiconductor industry. This was reported in a news article by GreenBiz on July 21, 2020. 

### human: 
Has the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the transition towards more sustainable technologies according to Al Gore? 
### assistant:Yes, according to Al Gore, the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have accelerated the shift towards more sustainable technologies. He indicated the change in attitudes and the reduction in travel coupled with the increase in work-from-home arrangements has contributed to this shift. Gore also mentions a correlation between the burning of fossil fuels and higher mortality rates under COVID-19, reinforcing the need to shift to more sustainable technologies. This information was reported by GreenBiz on July 21, 2020. 

### human: 
In Gore's view, what potential challenges could stand in the way of advances in environmental sustainability?
### assistant:According to Al Gore, challenges to the efficacy of self-government can stand in the way of advances in environmental sustainability. He mentions issues with partisanship, rejection of the authority of knowledge, and toleration of assaults on reason as problems. He also notes that misinformation strategies by powerful players in the economy pose a challenge. He carries the belief that democracy is the most efficient way to make collective decisions and that diversity allows any group or company to make smarter decisions.

What action did Tesla CEO Elon Musk threaten towards Alameda County in California, where the automaker's primary plant is located? How did he voice his frustrations and what were his plans? 

### assistant: 
Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, threatened to sue Alameda County, California, where the company's main factory is based, following a disagreement about when the company should be permitted to reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic. He expressed his frustrations on Twitter, stating he was considering moving Tesla’s headquarters to Texas or Nevada after the factory in Fremont, California, was not given permission to reopen. Alameda County officials stated agreement with Tesla to reopen the plant was close but Musk potentially disrupted the discussions. These events occurred on May 14, 2020, as reported by The New York Times. 

### human: 
How did other companies respond to the relaxation of lockdown measures during the pandemic?

### assistant: 
Different companies handled the easing of lockdown measures in various ways according to The New York Times report on May 14, 2020. For instance, Costco required shoppers to wear masks, a measure that clashed with guidance in some states where covering face was not mandated. This decision drew backlash from some shoppers. Furthermore,  billionaire investor Ken Griffin relocated a team of stock traders from their home bases in New York and Chicago to a hotel in Palm Beach, Florida. There were questions about whether CEOs might move operations to states with lower taxes, which also tended to relax lockdowns earlier than others.

What does the article reveal about the status of the airline industry during the pandemic?

### assistant: 
The article from The New York Times, dated May 14, 2020, shows that the airline industry was facing a significant crisis during the pandemic. Executives were uncertain about when passengers would return, predicting it could take years for airlines to fly as many passengers as they did pre-pandemic. Changes in post-pandemic measures, such as temperature checks and masks, might become standard features of air travel. Airlines that were in a good financial situation pre-crisis were resorting to financial triage before passengers returned in sufficient numbers. For instance, American Airlines expected to lose an average of $70 million per day in the second quarter.

What business changes are discussed in billionaire Michael Bloomberg's opinion piece about re-initiating operations amid the pandemic? 

### assistant: 
According to the May 14, 2020, article from The New York Times, Michael Bloomberg's Bloomberg Opinion piece recommended several business changes to help restart operations in the midst of the pandemic. He suggested companies should be shielded from lawsuits if they meet certain criteria, like providing workers with protective equipment and offering flexible sick leave. He also promoted the expansion of unemployment insurance for workers at high risk for Covid-19, allowing companies to offer tax-free “hazard pay” for essential employees. Bloomberg also argued for the relaxation of health-privacy laws that would prevent companies from verifying if employees had been sick or tracing their contacts.

With them, most states cut the share of jobless workers they helped.Now these requirements have been getting in the way. Effectively, many states have been trying to scale up aid with systems built to keep claims low.“In a time when pretty much everybody who’s applying should be eligible, we’re working with a system that got us to a 26 percent recipiency rate,” said Steve Gray, the director of Michigan’s Unemployment Insurance Agency. That means Michigan was giving aid to one in four unemployed workers in 2019, following restrictions adopted by the Michigan legislature after the Great Recession. That system, Mr. Gray said, was “built to assume that you’re guilty and make you prove that you’re innocent.”The crush of claims has demanded of states not just more server capacity and call-center workers, but also an abrupt change in the premise of the safety net: Systems trained to treat each case as potentially fraudulent must now presume that millions have legitimately lost their jobs.System crashes and website glitches are tied to this challenge, too. Requirements embedded in the architecture of unemployment must be turned off, worked around, or simply ignored.“If after you submit your application, you receive a message that states you are not covered and your claim has been denied, please disregard,” Kentucky’s unemployment website reads.“The Department of Economic Opportunity has suspended the requirement to provide work search contacts,” Florida’s system said, in red letters. But forms asking workers to document their job searches remained online for weeks.The hitches have frustrated Congress’s intent to steer trillions of dollars to workers.ARWVNYVAKSOHDENJIAUSInitial claimssince March 15TXMSNVRIAKIDNEHITNNDMDALMTCANCSDWALAUTGAINFLCTCOKYILWYNHPAMIWINMSCVTMNMAOKAZMEDCMOORTNAlabamaReceivingbenefitsVATXIALANCNVPAKYHIOKKSMDSDAKOHRICAILAZMNARINMSALWVMIVTCTMTWIFLWAGANDNJNYUSUTDCIDCONHWYMEORNMDENEMOMASCFlorida4%6%8%10%12%16%18%20%22%26%28%14%24%AlabamaKSInitial claimssince March 15WVTNDEOHNCTXMSVANYILNJNVALIACOVTHIAKRIARUSLAWISDCAWAUTPAWYOKMDGAMTKYNHIDINNDMIMANEFLNMSCAZMNMOMEDCORCTFloridaReceivingbenefitsVANCTNOHKSTXILIALANVSDARAKMDNJUSHICARIPAFLOROKWAWVVTALMTDENDINNYMNAZMIMSGAKYWINMCTIDUTNHCODCSCMOWYMANEME4%6%8%10%12%16%18%20%22%14%24%26%28%Initial claimssince March 15ReceivingbenefitsHIKY27%GARIMINVPA24%LAVTWA21%AKNHNJMAWVCAOHALMIMN18%ORDCINNVUSSCNYNYRIVTDEMTCTMSMEFLWAIA15%WVOKNCAKGAKSMONDWIPAMAMNNHCTIDLAAZOHNJVAORILKYARMTTNNM12%DCMDNCTXDEILUSCOWIHIMEWYTNSCNECAIANMND9%IDUTMOKSINARVAOKSDNEMSCOTXMDAL6%WYAlabamaAZUTSDFLFlorida3%Note: Initial claims include those made from March 15 to April 25.

Hawaii and Indiana lagged by that measure, too. Survey data from Gallup suggests that more workers in several states, including Oklahoma and Colorado, have lost work than are reflected in claims data through mid-April.And while every other state reported an increase in the number of people receiving unemployment insurance in the second week of April, Florida inexplicably reported a decrease of 162,000 people from the first week of the month.Once all of these workers get into the system, federal aid will help smooth some of the inequality in benefits across states.“That was on our minds every single day through all of this,” said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who pushed the expansion of unemployment benefits in the CARES Act. “That you could have an unemployed worker in State A getting less help than an unemployed worker in State B.”Congress pledged additional weeks of federally paid aid, ensuring that workers can receive up to 39 weeks even in states that have shortened their benefits. Congress funded an extra $600 per week, per worker, through July, lifting some maximum state payments as low as $235 to a more livable income. The bill also expanded benefits to self-employed and gig workers who make up more of the labor force in Florida, California and New York.But it is harder amid a crisis for Congress to counteract the subtler differences between states in access to aid.“What you can’t see in numbers is how hard it is to apply for unemployment insurance, state by state,” said Stephen Wandner, a senior fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance and a former U.S. Department of Labor official.Michigan has tried to undo some of its restrictions. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has temporarily pushed the maximum benefit duration back to 26 weeks, what the state offered before the cuts passed in 2011. She suspended criteria limiting which workers qualify and stretched the eligibility window to file a claim.Michigan has now fielded claims covering 20 percent of its work force, among the highest shares in the country, according to data reported Thursday. But the process has confounded many.Loretta Lee, who lives in Detroit, was furloughed in late March from her job in supply chain management for a manufacturer. The state unemployment site kept crashing; the system told her she was missing required information. She called an overloaded call center more than a thousand times. She called her U.S. senator, then her state senator.“I felt like a child,” said Ms. Lee, 32. “I was so helpless.”Finally, she reached a state worker by phone who told her to send in a copy of her pay stub — by fax, marked “Attention: Pam.” And so, wearing a mask, she took the pay stub to a hotel concierge desk, entrusting her personal financial information to a woman she did not know who had access to a fax machine in a pandemic.In the last recession, most states depleted their unemployment trust funds and had to borrow from the federal government. As the economy improved, they had two options: raise taxes on employers who fund unemployment insurance, or cut benefits to workers.Many chose the latter. Nine states cut the length of time workers could remain on unemployment. Others raised the minimum income to qualify, or cut weekly payouts.Florida moved to an electronic-only filing system that meant many workers erred on applications they filled out with no assistance.Michigan excluded some employees as seasonal workers. It shifted the burden for reporting past income from employers to employees. It redefined some job separations as “voluntary,” making those workers ineligible.“All of these things, they’re small,” said Luke Shaefer, a professor of social work and public policy at the University of Michigan. “If you looked at them on their own, you might imagine they’re totally reasonable. But they end up, layer after layer, adding red tape.”Over this time, denial rates across the country increased as workers stumbled over rules unrelated to the wages and layoffs that entitled them to unemployment insurance.VTRIWINJINGAUSIAOKTXMTARDCPAMECOMDSDMN2007HIKSAKVANDNHNEUTKYNYCTTNNVWYIDLAOHAZDEWVMSILWAMOCAORALFLMAMISCNCNMDCVAOKUSRIARWINDSDMDFLMTTXNJNVVTIAKSMS2018LAPANHTNHIINIDAKNEUTMNDESCCTGAWVILNCMIMEKYMOOHWAWYMAALCANMCOAZORNY2%4%6%8%10%12%14%GAWIIARIUSOK2007DCINTXVACONJMNILDEMEMTIDWVSDMDNHARMSNDUTWYTNNVAKNENYKSLAVTAZHIMOPACACTFLOHWAMIMANCKYORNMSCALOK2018DCUSMDSDIATNGARIWIPAFLMNNJVANDMTMSLATXNHVTIDHIARINNEUTNVCTKSAKKYSCCOWYNCMIWACADEMEMOILOHNYNMWVORAZALMA2%4%6%8%10%12%14%2007201816%MSSC14%NEUT12%INUT10%IDNDAKWY8%LAWINHLAMISDMOKSNEND6%TNNHWAHIFLOHAKCOIDNCTXMONMWYMEMNSDWAHI4%NVTXMEOHUSMTKSCONYOKALGAMDMDORDECAMADCNVARMNPAOKAZORKYAZMTVARIUSIA2%MIVAILMSWIALKYVTVTCAFLINDEWVNYARNJSCGADCNCCTRICTWVILNMIAMATNPANJNote: Includes denials not made for monetary or job separation reasons.Sources: Andrew Stettner, The Century Foundation; Department of LaborThe New York TimesBy 2019, one in 10 unemployed workers in North Carolina was receiving benefits, the lowest share in the nation. But the state’s trust fund was in far better shape than when the legislature passed tighter restrictions in 2013.“It was certainly a painful thing to do, and it was a tough vote,” said Tim Moore, now the Republican speaker of the North Carolina State House. “The balance that we had to strike was between making sure we’re taking care of somebody who truly can’t find a job, versus allowing in folks who simply did not want to work.”That balance has been vindicated today, he said, as the state now has more money on hand to pay unemployment claims in a crisis. “Had we not made those changes,” Mr. Moore said, “we would be in a real mess right now going into this economic downturn.”People who fiercely opposed the changes at the time counter that workers now face mass unemployment with weakened benefits.“It’s now coming back to haunt us,” said the Rev. William J. Barber II, who led weekly protests against the legislature at the time. “What they did was terrible, immoral and bad. But now, with this pandemic on top of it, it’s going to be even greater in terms of its pain.”Rita Blalock, who works at a McDonald’s in Raleigh, tried to apply for newly expanded aid after her hours were cut. A friend had to fill out the online application for her, and it took two weeks to file her claim. Ms. Blalock, 53, has no smartphone and no computer.“McDonald’s pays me $9 an hour, so how could I afford that stuff?” she said. She believes her claim has been accepted, but is still waiting for her first payment.No state unemployment system could have handled this smoothly. State offices have fielded more applications in a single day than they did in the worst weeks of the Great Recession. Adding $600 to every payment has been no small task. And Congress effectively asked states to create an entirely new benefit, expanding aid to self-employed workers whose wages can’t be verified on a pay stub. As of Wednesday, just 21 states had begun that program.It can be hard, then, to tell which breakdowns are fair game for criticism — and eventually reform.“The failures are policy failures,” said Seth Harris, a former deputy labor secretary in the Obama administration. He distinguishes those decisions from the efforts of agency workers. “The failures are in the states that in their basic U.I. program offer fewer than 26 weeks of benefits — that’s a failure. The failures are in the states that narrowed eligibility — that’s a grotesque failure.”But in many ways, those policies are inseparable from the technical failures. Even states like Florida that have nominally more modern systems have still built into them obstacles that make them hard to use.People talk about making these systems work better in a crisis, said Jennifer Pahlka, the founder of Code for America, who is now part of a team of volunteers helping states with their unemployment systems. “But if you’re poor in America, you’re having this kind of battle,” she said, “pretty much every day.”Now more than 30 million people — including middle-class workers who’ve never touched the safety net before — have seen firsthand what that means.Ms. Lee, who finally received her first payment this week in Detroit, just as she was recalled to work, learned this lesson in all the obstacles she encountered: “I think they do this for people to give up.”","TheNewYorkTimes: 2020-04-30 Percentage of unemployed people who received benefitsMOWVNVGAIAWYALVTKYLAMNMTNMUSVAOKIDPATNINAKCOND2007ILRIMESDDEWIDCCATXMANJKSARNENCORFLAZWACTUTMIHIMSSCNHMDOHNY2019MOOKWVGAMTKYIDSDAZUSMNRIDCNMCOMDNVILNDVTLADEVANCMANJWYARIAINPAORAKFLTNCTMENHOHALWIHINYKSMIMSTXCAUTNEWASC10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45%50%55%60%Percentage of unemployed people who received benefitsND2007IANMNVMOGAMNWVALKYLAVTMTWYILVAPAUSOKIDAKCORIMETNSDWIDEARCADCFLNJTXMANCORCTNEUTNHMIINAZOHMDSCKSNYMSHIWA2019NMWVOKMOGASDMTUSKYNVMDRIVAMNLANDIDILDENCCOVTAKAZALMANJIANHFLORDCPAWYMIOHCTWITNARCAINNYMSHIMEKSWASCNETXUT10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45%50%55%60%Percentage of unemployed people who received benefits2019200760%NJPADENJ55%IDMAMA50%WIAKCTVT45%CTRIVTORNVRIARIAMTCAIL40%NYIAMNMICAMNPAHIINHIILUSMDMTWVNC35%NDNYNEORNMMEALSCWANDNVFL30%WIMOWYOHAKTNUSNHWAKYKSMIWVDEAZVAGAMEDC25%MSDCIDARLATXOKALUTCOMDSCOHMOCO20%UTOKKYWYTXNMKSINSDNHVA15%GATNNEAZMSLAFLSD10%NCThe state unemployment systems that were supposed to help millions of jobless workers were full of boxes to check and mandates to meet that couldn’t possibly apply in a pandemic.States required workers to document their job searches, weekly; to register with employment services, in person; to take a wait period before their first check, up to 10 days.Such requirements increased in the years following the Great Recession, as many states moved to tighten access to or reduce unemployment benefits. With them, most states cut the share of jobless workers they helped.Now these requirements have been getting in the way. Effectively, many states have been trying to scale up aid with systems built to keep claims low.“In a time when pretty much everybody who’s applying should be eligible, we’re working with a system that got us to a 26 percent recipiency rate,” said Steve Gray, the director of Michigan’s Unemployment Insurance Agency. That means Michigan was giving aid to one in four unemployed workers in 2019, following restrictions adopted by the Michigan legislature after the Great Recession. That system, Mr. Gray said, was “built to assume that you’re guilty and make you prove that you’re innocent.”The crush of claims has demanded of states not just more server capacity and call-center workers, but also an abrupt change in the premise of the safety net: Systems trained to treat each case as potentially fraudulent must now presume that millions have legitimately lost their jobs.System crashes and website glitches are tied to this challenge, too.

What does the New York Times say about the state of unemployment systems and the people trying to claim benefits in the USA?

### assistant :



According to the New York Times, the unemployment systems across various US states are currently inadequate and have been seen as obstacles by millions of people seeking jobless benefits. These systems, which were tightened and made more restrictive following the Great Recession, now demand that the unemployed document their job searches weekly, register with employment services in-person, and wait for a certain period before they receive their first check. When the pandemic hit, many state systems were stuck having to scale up aid with structures originally designed to keep claims low. Workers are frequently upset by system crashes and website glitches. 

The Congress, aiming to steer trillions of dollars to workers, has been thwarted by these system issues. States such as Florida, Alabama, Hawaii and Indiana have a relatively low number of workers receiving jobless benefits compared to all the initial claims filed. The system issues have not only affected the dispersion of financial aid, but also make it hard for Congress to address the more subtle differences between states in terms of aid access. 

Despite the challenges, some positive adjustments have been made such as in Michigan where there have been attempts to undo some of the restrictions on unemployment benefits. Changes such as the successful push to expand unemployment benefits in the CARES Act have helped. But overall, the various systems are still causing plenty of frustration and present a real obstacle for those seeking support. This news was reported by the New York Times on April 30, 2020."
631111e58719a4ef8a8a2d6e,TheNewYorkTimes,Opportunities,"Gantz to Meet Trump on Peace Plan, but Alone, Not With Netanyahu",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/middleeast/israel-gantz-peace-plan.html?searchResultPosition=285,2020-01-28,David M. Halbfinger,"RAMAT GAN, Israel — Benny Gantz, the former Israeli military chief making a third attempt to unseat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Saturday that he would visit President Trump on his own in Washington on Monday to discuss a White House proposal for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Calling himself “the president’s full and committed partner,” Mr. Gantz pointedly said, in English, that he would be meeting with Mr. Trump “as the leader of the largest party in Israel,” the centrist Blue and White faction.Mr. Gantz also gave measured praise to Mr. Trump’s proposal, about which he said he had already been told a good deal by administration officials. The surprise announcement means Mr. Gantz will avoid an awkward three-way meeting with Mr. Trump that Mr. Netanyahu had sought to orchestrate at the White House on Tuesday, five weeks before Israel’s March 2 election, the third ballot in a year. The first two ended in deadlock.Crucially, it also means Mr. Gantz will be able to fly back to Israel in time to oversee a key proceeding Tuesday regarding Mr. Netanyahu’s attempt to obtain parliamentary immunity from prosecution on serious corruption charges. Lawmakers are expected to reject the request, with Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, vowing to boycott Tuesday’s debate in protest, but if Mr. Gantz were in Washington, that likely would have been delayed.In effect, Mr. Gantz, who had seemingly been cornered by the White House invitation, found an unseen exit, allowing him to avoid aiding Mr. Netanyahu without offending Israel’s closest and most powerful ally.“Following this important meeting, I will return to Israel in order to lead the debates regarding Netanyahu’s immunity from up close,” Mr. Gantz said in Hebrew, in an announcement that was carried live by Israeli television.“These are not regular days for the state of Israel,” he added.A meeting of the American president and Israeli prime minister with Mr. Gantz, who is merely a member of Parliament, could have embarrassed him in the eyes of Israelis. Mr. Netanyahu could have put him on the spot before the cameras by cajoling Mr. Gantz to join a unity government after the March 2 election. It would have meant communicating in English, in which Mr. Netanyahu is peerless among Israeli politicians and Mr. Gantz is much less comfortable.Mr. Gantz, who is tacking to the right in his campaign this time, was full of praise for Mr. Trump, calling him “a true friend of the state of Israel, the citizens of Israel and the Jews of the United States,” and saying his leadership “has made the alliance between us deeper, stronger and more powerful than ever.”While couched in laudatory terms, Mr. Gantz’s remarks about the Trump administration’s proposal for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, about which he said he had been amply briefed, was full of subtle caveats, and referred to its potential rather than to the probability or certainty of its success.He said the proposal could be “a basis for progress” toward “an agreed-to arrangement” with the Palestinians, “in tandem with continued and deeper strategic partnership with Jordan, Egypt and other countries in the region.”He said the plan would go down in history “as a significant milestone that defines the path down which the various parties to the conflict in the Middle East can walk to a regional and historic agreement.” But he did not indicate how much farther that path might lead.The Israeli news media has been full of leaks of supposed details of the plan, saying it would pave the way for annexation of significant portions of the West Bank including all but a small number of Jewish settlements in occupied Palestinian territory. The Palestinians insist it will be dead on arrival.Many analysts and supporters of a two-state solution to the conflict have called the promised rollout of the plan this week a distraction from Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial and an attempt by Mr. Netanyahu to shift the election campaign from a referendum on him to a discussion of what he calls a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity to expand Israeli territory. Regardless, the White House invitation, delivered by Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem on Thursday, had put Mr. Gantz in a bind.Aides said it would be difficult and politically costly to turn down a presidential summons. Weighing against that, they said, was a belief that the invitation was a trap, laid by Mr. Netanyahu with the cooperation of his allies in the Trump administration.Before Mr. Gantz’s announcement, a few activists outside shouted pleas for him to spurn the president’s call to Washington.“Bibi laid a honey trap for him,” said Shai Erel, 61, a contractor. “He mustn’t fly as Netanyahu’s plus-one and be the escort of a not-yet-elected prime minister.”But a separate meeting on Monday is not risk-free for Mr. Gantz. A career military man, he only entered politics a year ago and has yet to face an English-language press corps or a stage anything like that of the White House. And aides to Mr. Netanyahu signaled they would seek to magnify the contrast, with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reporting after Mr. Gantz’s remarks that Mr. Netanyahu now planned to hold an additional meeting of his own with Mr. Trump on Monday, denying Mr. Gantz a news cycle to himself.","TheNewYorkTimes: 2020-01-28 RAMAT GAN, Israel — Benny Gantz, the former Israeli military chief making a third attempt to unseat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Saturday that he would visit President Trump on his own in Washington on Monday to discuss a White House proposal for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Calling himself “the president’s full and committed partner,” Mr. Gantz pointedly said, in English, that he would be meeting with Mr. Trump “as the leader of the largest party in Israel,” the centrist Blue and White faction.Mr. Gantz also gave measured praise to Mr. Trump’s proposal, about which he said he had already been told a good deal by administration officials.

Lawmakers are expected to reject the request, with Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, vowing to boycott Tuesday’s debate in protest, but if Mr. Gantz were in Washington, that likely would have been delayed.In effect, Mr. Gantz, who had seemingly been cornered by the White House invitation, found an unseen exit, allowing him to avoid aiding Mr. Netanyahu without offending Israel’s closest and most powerful ally.“Following this important meeting, I will return to Israel in order to lead the debates regarding Netanyahu’s immunity from up close,” Mr. Gantz said in Hebrew, in an announcement that was carried live by Israeli television.“These are not regular days for the state of Israel,” he added.A meeting of the American president and Israeli prime minister with Mr. Gantz, who is merely a member of Parliament, could have embarrassed him in the eyes of Israelis. Mr. Netanyahu could have put him on the spot before the cameras by cajoling Mr. Gantz to join a unity government after the March 2 election. It would have meant communicating in English, in which Mr. Netanyahu is peerless among Israeli politicians and Mr. Gantz is much less comfortable.Mr. Gantz, who is tacking to the right in his campaign this time, was full of praise for Mr. Trump, calling him “a true friend of the state of Israel, the citizens of Israel and the Jews of the United States,” and saying his leadership “has made the alliance between us deeper, stronger and more powerful than ever.”While couched in laudatory terms, Mr. Gantz’s remarks about the Trump administration’s proposal for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, about which he said he had been amply briefed, was full of subtle caveats, and referred to its potential rather than to the probability or certainty of its success.He said the proposal could be “a basis for progress” toward “an agreed-to arrangement” with the Palestinians, “in tandem with continued and deeper strategic partnership with Jordan, Egypt and other countries in the region.”He said the plan would go down in history “as a significant milestone that defines the path down which the various parties to the conflict in the Middle East can walk to a regional and historic agreement.” But he did not indicate how much farther that path might lead.The Israeli news media has been full of leaks of supposed details of the plan, saying it would pave the way for annexation of significant portions of the West Bank including all but a small number of Jewish settlements in occupied Palestinian territory. The Palestinians insist it will be dead on arrival.Many analysts and supporters of a two-state solution to the conflict have called the promised rollout of the plan this week a distraction from Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial and an attempt by Mr. Netanyahu to shift the election campaign from a referendum on him to a discussion of what he calls a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity to expand Israeli territory. Regardless, the White House invitation, delivered by Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem on Thursday, had put Mr. Gantz in a bind.Aides said it would be difficult and politically costly to turn down a presidential summons. Weighing against that, they said, was a belief that the invitation was a trap, laid by Mr. Netanyahu with the cooperation of his allies in the Trump administration.Before Mr. Gantz’s announcement, a few activists outside shouted pleas for him to spurn the president’s call to Washington.“Bibi laid a honey trap for him,” said Shai Erel, 61, a contractor. “He mustn’t fly as Netanyahu’s plus-one and be the escort of a not-yet-elected prime minister.”But a separate meeting on Monday is not risk-free for Mr. Gantz. A career military man, he only entered politics a year ago and has yet to face an English-language press corps or a stage anything like that of the White House. And aides to Mr. Netanyahu signaled they would seek to magnify the contrast, with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reporting after Mr. Gantz’s remarks that Mr. Netanyahu now planned to hold an additional meeting of his own with Mr. Trump on Monday, denying Mr. Gantz a news cycle to himself.","### human: 
Who is set to visit the White House to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict proposal and what impact would that meeting have on the Israeli elections and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bid for immunity from corruption charges?
### assistant:;
Benny Gantz, the former Israeli military chief and leader of the centrist Blue and White faction, has announced that he will meet President Trump in Washington on Monday, Jan. 27, 2020, to discuss a White House proposal for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This would mean that Gantz can return to Israel in time for a crucial proceeding regarding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attempt to seek parliamentary immunity from serious corruption charges. The lawmakers are expected to reject Netanyahu's request, especially if Gantz is present. If Gantz were in Washington during the proceedings, this would have likely been delayed. Furthermore, this meeting allows Gantz to evade an awkward arranged meeting with Trump and Netanyahu at the White House. The separate meetings thus give Gantz a chance to disassociate himself from Netanyahu without upsetting the relations with the United States, Israel's closest ally (source: The New York Times, 2020-01-28)."
